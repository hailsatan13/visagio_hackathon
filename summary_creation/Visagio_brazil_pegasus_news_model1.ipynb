Australia has the world's lowest uptake of dairy products and the traditional diets are widely disliked for being inadequate in meeting nutritional requirements, the researchers say, adding that many people don’t understand what is considered a healthy food plan, particularly in an ageing population with a high rate of cardiac and cardiovascular disease. “Incorporating dairy improves the health of the body, which may make it more appealing to older people with conditions like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and cancer,” she said.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-in a field that is still largely experimental, doctors at Massachusetts Eye and Ear used electrical stimulation to coax olfactory nerves in five people with lost sense of smell to send sensory signals into the deeper brain areas of the brain to make them perceive odors as they would smell from their natural nose. “The technology may someday be applicable to many other problems in the human body, like asthma,” said Holbrook, “and we are encouraged that this new technology can help people who suffer from smell deprivation, even though it is far from being proven in human studies.” Smell deprivation occurs when nerves that regulate the way smells get to the senses are damaged or blocked, and can be the result of head trauma, allergies and aging, or simply from not eating enough of certain food items. Implants to restore the sense of smell in those who have lost the sense are currently in development but have been shown only to restore sensation in the ears in some patients. Implanted electrodes, like those used for cochlear implants, are surgically placed inside the ears and stimulate nerves to send auditory signals from the nose back into the brain.

            "Summary Generated:--Identification of cancer-fighting gene markers will save money and time, but will also increase health issues. -Cancers containing genetic markers are not dangerous, but containing the same chemical alterations which could make it dangerous, so a test with only the genetic markers to indicate cancer should have better odds at identifying manageable cancer, which requires fewer medical procedures and is less expensive than cancerous cells without the chemical changes. -Detecting cancer genes using computer algorithms could save men thousands of pounds per year, while reducing unnecessary operations and radiotherapy, but may not prevent all cancer from coming back, meaning fewer patients will receive treatment. -Measuring the levels of cancer gene genes is a simple test which is accurate and can distinguish between deadly prostate cancers and manageable tumors, which may reduce costs and side-effects of cancer care, whilst saving men hundreds of pounds per year from having to go and see a urologist every year for prostate cancer, as well as costing £10,000 per operation, or radiotherapy, for every prostate cancer that doesn't cause significant damage, which could lead to a reduced cost to the National healthcare system, with a lower total cost of therapy to the patients and less money spent on each operation.\n",

Cannabidiol (NCB) is a natural compound that promotes an anti-inflammatory response in the brain. NCB also inhibits the production of serotonin and norepinephrine, two chemicals which can be thought of as being important to the development and functioning of the brain, which is why treatment for bipolar disorders is extremely difficult. NCB is not currently used as a psychiatric treatment for depression and has only been tested in the treatment of bipolar.' said the researchers, who will present the results of the randomised, double blind study to a large conference in the country in which they were presented, tomorrow, 25th of October, at 9.00am (12:00pm, local time) in a paper entitled,'Cannabidiol reduces depressive episodes and mood disorders, including bipolar disorder by blocking an important class of inflammatory molecules', at the 9th international meeting on the treatment of depression in the digestive tract.

            "Summary Generated:-the analysis suggests that early-stage angioplasty, when combined with medication, is much more effective in reducing the need for heart surgery and subsequent hospital treatment compared to medication alone in treating stable coronary artery stenosis, a form of heart disease that is commonly seen in patients without a history of heart attacks but does occur in people who do if there is no previous blockage of the arteries that carry blood around the body. \"The findings of this study support existing guidelines for using stents and medication to treat coronary artery stenosis and are important in helping us to understand why many of our patients are not being diagnosed earlier and why fewer than 1 in 4 people with coronary artery stenosis actually have a prior heart attack before their next one, and why fewer than 1 out of 10 people who need coronary artery bypass surgery die from a cardiovascular disease,\" said co-lead author and professor of medicine and pharmacology at the hospital's division of cardiac surgery, Dr. John de la Tour. \"Implementing these new findings, we want to encourage doctors in countries where coronary artery disease is a big problem to use PCI early, in order to save patients' lives, and help prevent future heart attacks and other events that cause heart death each year, which can lead to long-term health complications,\" he added.\n",

Carmichael and his team have begun to explore the potential for this approach in humans, though they still need to establish the mechanisms of its success and whether it may be applicable in the short-term, as well as long-term. \"This work could potentially be a new approach for recovering from stroke, but until we have more data to back up our claims, we cannot say if this will work for patients who are going to have permanent brain damage, or only if it is safe and effective for people who are living with chronic stroke, where brain death is inevitable after a few weeks after the stroke injury, and the body is still very inflamed and damaged, which is why there is no way to regenerate brain tissue that died in a stroke without killing the brain cells and leaving a hole that can remain inactive for many months,\" said Carmichael, who leads the Translational and Regenerative Neuroscience group at the Sackler Institute of Neurological and Head of Translational and Regenerative neuroscience at the university.\n",

UTA has developed a cancer trap for both diagnosing and treating breast cancer, melanoma and other cancers at the earlier stages when it can be easier to detect the cancer’s progression and treatment. “This is a novel technology that we can apply to the entire body of cancer patients, including prostate, bladder and lung cancer where there is currently limited therapies to prevent their spreading and prolong the patient’s lifespan,” he said, “it could also be a very effective method to treat melanoma because the cancer cells in that tumor are quite similar to that of the melanoma itself, so it will work very well to treat that particular cancer.” Tang said he anticipates that his technology could be applied to prostate cancer patients who have recently received surgery and radiotherapy for their cancerous tumor and to melanoma patients who are recovering after chemotherapy. “In addition, it could be used to kill leukemia cells which may be very helpful in late stage cancer as they are resistant to current therapies and also have very good survival record, which is something that is very rare to find in most types of cancers in the early years of this disease,” he said, “which means that this would potentially significantly extend the length of the lives of patients who have already lived to a fairly good duration before their cancer became cancer and they didn’t survive after surgery,” he added.\n",

The first patient enrolled was a 29-year-old female with epilepsy who had been unresponsive to standard drug treatments and had seizures on occasion, even when the drug regimen was maximally well-established, causing her to experience high levels of stress and worry about how she could cope with the consequences. “When he was being monitored by our physicians, we noticed he seemed more calm and content than he has previously been and felt a real sense of well-being.” The patient has been participating in the clinical study for approximately a year now. “it makes me so happy because every time someone says that it made me more calm and happier and happier,” said the patient. “every time it’s from getting off and doing from me and happy and having from my own from this.”\n",

(abstracts and video are available for free on the meeting's website at www.abstracts.com.) Liver cancer is a leading cause of death among older adults and is responsible for about 10,000 cancer-related deaths per year. Liver cancer patients often live with chronic diseases that increase their chances of liver cancer spreading, such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C, and other blood diseases. Liver cancer can also be hard to diagnose and treat, making them an especially problematic area to treat. \"Patients may benefit by having a less invasive treatment option that offers a better chance of finding and killing the cancer, which would make a huge difference in the life of a patient living with a cancer diagnosis that could not be treated before, and in their ability to get the transplant,\" said Raman. \"Importantly, we have shown that this approach does not cause permanent damage to liver cells or to liver structures, and that this treatment is safe to use without serious adverse side effects.\"\n",

The new Spectra waveWriter(TM) spinal cord stimulation system combines two therapy platforms intended for pain relief with a single, convenient and user-friendly medical device to help clinicians personalize the pain relief of chronic pain sufferers. Boston Scientific's latest technology represents the company's continued commitment to research and expanding pain relief therapies for patients who currently can't afford opioids, a problem exacerbated by prescription opioid misuse and abuse. The Spectra WaveWriter System was developed as a result of clinical study studies and will now be sold through a national distribution network of medical facilities throughout the northeastern United States and Canada. BostonScientific is launching this innovative pain relief treatment to millions of pain patients in the states and the country, where it will be used to address the challenges associated with chronic pain and help patients with pain relief from alleviating the intensity of their pain while achieving their desired outcomes.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-, migraine surgery has been shown to be highly effective in reducing pain for patients, but its efficacy in relieving functional pain and coping ability is unclear, because most studies using pain questionnaires only measure headache frequency and severity, not functional disability, which may vary significantly between patients. In a new, prospective, controlled trial, patients who underwent migraine surgery demonstrated significantly higher-than-normal improvements in pain coping after surgery than patients with other types of pain, regardless of the type of pain condition they were already suffering from at baseline. (Migraine surgery was also much better than other nonsurgical treatments at reducing pain and functional disability in this study, including nonsurgical treatment for pain associated with lower back pain or pain associated with nerve impairments, even though it was not the first or only treatment that was used to measure pain coping abilities.) The researchers caution against relying too much on migraines as the only pain condition assessed, especially in patients with other kinds of chronic pain, because migraine surgery is not an easy treatment to determine if someone is adequately coping with chronic pain before surgery, and can be a difficult and expensive alternative to treating chronic pain.\n",

In this study ibuprofen and acetaminophen were studied as a non-opioid analgesic to determine whether they were more effective in decreasing pain after 2 hours, when patients were first admitted to the emergency department, or if any difference persisted two hours after being taken from one of 3 different acetaminophen/impulse drugs (injection, tablet, and oral) compared to opioids (in prescription only, 30 mg codeine and 30 mg hydrocodone; or 30 mg hydrocodone with 300 mg codeine) or codeine with 300 mg codeine and 100 mg codeine), but no differences were observed. Patients receiving ibuprofen had the greatest reduction in pain after 2 hours, with a 23.5% decrease, followed by ibuprofen with 20.2% decrease, and acetaminophen/iphodiaquinoline with 26.3% decrease; oxycodone had a 20.3% decrease, while hydrocodone was 20.2% decrease, both groups were similar in terms of pain reduction at two hours. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrated that acetaminophen + ibuprofen was an effective, safe and non-addictive pain reliever for adults coming to the emergency department for injury-related arm or leg pain, but did not differ from three other comparison opioids for opioid analgesics for pain after 2 hours.\n",

(Larger studies on iron deficiency were not performed in this study, which is an update of a smaller study on adolescent hemoglobin testing from earlier in the same research career.) \"We're hoping this will help physicians and clinics decide if they want to perform a blood test for iron deficiency, or just hemoglobin test, in these younger women, as opposed to waiting to do something with older women who may have been diagnosed with iron deficiency, which may be more costly to perform and could potentially predispose them to future issues,\" said lead researcher Sekhar, a pediatrics resident in the faculty of nutrition at the medical school and the pediatric division of infectious disease and community health. \"Screening for iron deficiency can prevent a number of serious health issues including anemia and potentially pregnancy-related health issues as well as social and behavioral issues that may contribute to lower test scores, such as poor concentration, hyperactivity and sleep disturbance, and possibly infant health issues as well as maternal health concerns,\" she said.\n",

BOTOX has been developed to help relieve depression by inhibiting thietrogenic factors (those which cause wrinkle formation) that occur naturally in the nervous system, including glutamate and serotonin, which may contribute to depression. BOTOX 30 U/ 50 U offers a shorter treatment time and a significantly higher dose than the 50 U+ BOTOX formulation, making it ideal for treating depression, while offering a similar effect on muscle tone. BOTOX® 50 U is indicated to help improve mood by inhibiting glutamate, a neurotransmitter commonly thought to play a role in depressive disorders. BOTOX® 30 U offers an alternative treatment to patients who have difficulty managing their depression because of limitations on their ability to maintain their normal self-image; BOTOX® 50 u provides a more relaxing and effective treatment option for those patients who need an alternative to the current standard of care for depression treatment. BOTOX® is available in two formulations (injectable 20 ml twice a day and injection 100 ml once daily) through the brand-name tazarotene for men and women with active male sex glands, and is marketed in over 30 countries under the brand names BOTOX and g-upetatonine for men and women.\n",

The new work is a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms by which the brain creates fear memories in order to help us understand how our brains respond when we experience traumatic events such as witnessing or being in an attack on someone else, and how these memories can lead to mental problems. it may also pave the way to therapies to prevent or treat PTSD.\" * fear memory refers to associations between specific stimuli or events, and can be created through memory creation, such as associating colours with electricity or associating certain events, such as hearing noises or being shocked by an electric shock, as a fear memory. Experiments have previously shown that the brain uses proteins called matrix enzymes to process stimuli, including noises, so we thought we could prevent these proteins from forming fear memories. doxycycline does this, and the results of this study show that doxycycline can suppress a brain enzyme that is essential to forming a fearful memory in humans, potentially delaying the onset of fear memory formation for people with PTSD.*\n",

            "Summary Generated:-screening for lung cancer in underserved communities and populations can be effective and easy-to-follow, with high rates of cancer finding itself early in a year or two, compared with previous research involving similar sites in the same community, according to a recent study at theGeorgia Cancer Center at the Georgia Cooperative Regents university at the expense of a public health grant. Screenings like the one that were undertaken in 2014, when a screening device used in these cases could only detect cancers at a very small dose, may not be as effective at finding cancers at an even smaller amount of time in patients who do show any signs of disease, but can find more cancers before they have a chance to progress, the authors note. \"The results are impressive, but they're not as clear cut as previous reports, especially in underserved populations and areas that have less than 1 percent of residents having smoked cigarettes in the past 30 years, which are a major reason why there is such a high survival rate\" for lung cancer, the authors note. \"We'll have to retest it and do more research before we say this will become a regular thing in our region, but it is definitely worth the trouble.\" Screening can also be done by going to the doctor if you have a history of symptoms; if your doctor tells you you don't have symptoms, ask them to check your body for lung tumors; if you get symptoms, you can take it to the doctor and find your cancer and go to the doctor.\n",

In a new study published online earlier in CANCER, the researchers find that consumption of soy products appears to protect breast cancer patients, while not having a large detrimental effect on women who were treated with hormonal therapies, which are still the best treatments. \"Consuming a diet that contains a sufficient amount of is oflavones might help breast cancer patients to live longer by preventing cancer growth, while not having any negative effect on hormonal therapy itself,\" concluded the researchers, who include scientists from the American Society for Clinical Oncology, the Massachusetts GeneralHospital, the Harvard- and Columbia- affiliated Brigham and Women's hospital, and the departments of anthropology and kinesiology at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, in an article titled \" Soy-based diets are safe but not always effective for breast cancer patients: results of an observational study.\"\n",

Appropriate treatment of an ear malformation in infancy reduces the likelihood of subsequent surgeries, which may be extremely painful and costly.\" The researchers also note the need to train doctors and nurses on the treatment system--a process that can be performed by ear surgeons who have been trained in other techniques, but do not use the Earwell system. \"Parents and caregivers should know when to seek treatment for their infants, how long to wait to start, and what method is used,\" they write, \"especially if they're premature or have had a baby too small to get surgery early enough to benefit from this non-surgical method of treatment.\"\n",

(n = 58) [1]. the study results suggest that brachytherapy may be a safe, effective outpatient alternative to more invasive and potentially more painful procedures, and may also improve patient outcomes by making this treatment more convenient than the more commonly used procedure. (i.e., single visit to the local radiation clinic is the safest and most effective alternative for patients with prostate cancer who cannot safely be treated by other procedures and who might not appreciate the additional stress and time required for surgery, which could result in a longer follow- up period or worse side effects). (ii) the study found no significant differences between the rates of recurrence and progression of prostate cancer at one year in patients who received the single dose of brachytherapy, which may make this therapy an option for patients with localized prostate cancer who would benefit from a shorter treatment duration compared with traditional treatments. (vii) this may allow patients to receive less aggressive therapy, but without any additional complications, thus reducing their overall treatment and radiation costs. [viii] “we are seeing a dramatic reduction in treatment fees and a greater convenience in prostate cancer treatment with this method of brachytherapy, and these results are exciting for patients who would like to live longer with better quality of life and fewer side effects,” added Krauss.\n",

Breastcancer.org recommends that all women 40 years or older should start receiving supplemental breast cancer screening by age 50 with no history of screening, or at age 40 if their risk is at least five times normal for their age or if they are diagnosed after a screening mammogram has revealed any suspicious or suspicious findings; or at any age if there is evidence that they were screened improperly, or that they were treated inappropriately, including mastectomy or reconstructive surgery; or if their breast cancer was localized or was not surgically removed, and their cancer has returned or spread to another site in their breast after screening. \"Screening by breast cancer screening method is recommended for women at risk for breast cancer, especially when the screening method is not widely used and is inadequate in detecting breast cancer in low-risk women because they are at high or very low risk for the disease,\" the researchers conclude.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Trulance improves the bowel movements in constipation patients, resulting in reduced stool frequency, constipation symptoms and improved bowel movement quality and consistency, which are important to a functioning digestive system. “Patients should continue using other treatments to manage constipation such as exercise and dietary supplementation, and not take a medication that can potentially cause constipation if your digestive system is not acting as expected, such as an oral laxative or an iron deficiency remedy,” said, who noted that there was no treatment that could be used in the same patient populations for all constipations, and that it is not possible to know for certain what happens when a constipation drug is used in a patient population until you have been exposed to it for a long period of time. “The availability of new therapies like Trulance helps physicians make better informed decisions about what treatment option to use for their patient, helping patients get back to the routine of life and living a normal life,” continued,who also added that constipation drugs are not the first choice for constipation patients.\n",

(image: courtesy of the journal Circulation) Identifying patients who are not benefitting from aggressive blood pressure treatment will help improve outcomes for those who do, and will also prevent many heart attacks, strokes and deaths, according to an analysis of data from the large-scale national cardiovascular clinical trial that was the first large study to use cardiac calcium scores as an alternative to risk equations in blood pressure care.  The new analysis is the first to apply this approach to people who were not at heightened risk for heart disease.  It may also help people who are currently on medication, or who are already at heightened risk for heart attack and heart failure, who may need fewer doses of medications but are not at higher risk because of their own reactions to blood pressure medications, or even because of other risk factors, the researchers say.  \"We found that coronary artery calcium scored as a separate calculation for each patient is an accurate way of assessing the appropriateness of treatment, which can result in better outcomes and more effective control of a patient's blood pressure than the traditional calculations done for each patient by risk factors like age, body mass index and cholesterol density.  Patients with relatively small coronary arteries could potentially benefit from less intensive and less expensive blood pressure treatment because they have much more calcium than a normal person, who may be more at high risk, but who are at lesser risk,\" he says.\n",
