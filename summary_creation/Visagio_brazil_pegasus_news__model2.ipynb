            "Summary Generated:-A new device could provide a new weapon to help fight obesity and its many health-related problems -- without the headaches of bulky batteries and electrical currents or the ongoing maintenance that is typically involved with existing drugs and surgical devices to stimulate a particular nerve or part of the brain to regulate how much we can handle. The device, which can be implantable using a minimally- invasive procedure, is small enough for rats to carry around and generated gentle electricity when the rats' stomach moved. When removed, the devices restored rats' appetites, and they gained back less than a pound a week after returning to the same proportions they had prior to removing the devices. It also offers a more flexible approach than existing systems that involve external batteries, complex wiring and long-term maintenance requirements. \"That's another reason these systems are being tested in humans now, so we can get them into a human clinical setting where they can have the same results as those in the animals,\" says Wang, a materials scientist who has spent the past decade developing devices for the medical and dental fields.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-A new study shows that in a combination of chemotherapy and gene editing, tumors grow smaller and volume is decreased in a mouse that has been treated with lung cancer. The research could provide a new approach to treating lung cancer and may also lead to future applications of gene editing in other diseases such as diabetes, according to scientists at Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, who are collaborating on the study. The gene-editing method, called CRISPR-Cas 9, targets a specific type of gene that is critical for cancer survival, but the study finds that in addition to preventing tumors from growing, CRISPR-Cas9, also disables another important gene in the body that helps these cancers resist the chemotherapy agent iris or docetaxel, helping them to grow faster, survive longer and prevent them from returning. The findings, published in the Journal of Medical Oncology, were supported by the Whitehead Cancer Center and Christiana Medical Research Foundation, along with several foundations that have committed to supporting the work of the gene- Editing Institute and Christiana Care Health System.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-About three years ago there were few treatments that could reverse the course of depression. That changed after the emergence of mood-enhancing drugs and the rise of prescription antidepressants, but today there are some surprising approaches that might be able to treat mood disorders and other psychiatric problems. Some are using probiotics, which have been associated with better health in mice, as an alternative to psychotherapy, antidepressants or other medications. In a study published in Nature, researchers from Sheppard Pratt report that adding a fermented probiotic supplement was linked to significant improvement in mood among bipolar patients. The results may be good news for people who have bipolar disorder, or anyone living with psychiatric disorders, because these treatments can have many of the same positive benefits, but they require a long-lasting commitment from patients and their doctors, and the results of this research could open up many new medical avenues, including treatments that use probiotic microbes to fight off the onset of disease. Here are a few more promising ideas that might be worth considering if your doctor wants to consider treating your psychiatric disorder, especially if your condition is linked to an gastrointestinal tract disorder like bipolar disorder.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Thousands of people will get better health outcomes if they supplemented with dairy to the MedDiet. A recent study shows this would be even better than the current low- Fat Diet. The University of South Australia says it is an ideal option for those seeking to improve their health, but many people are not familiar with the benefits of dairy, especially because it is more in fat than the traditional MedDiet and is perceived as healthier than its low fat counterparts, which is also known for their benefits to cardiovascular health. This is a major finding because we know that diets rich in fats can actually be bad for the body and contribute to the accumulation of fat in our arteries, contributing to the onset of heart disease, which leads to death. In contrast to the healthy fats, milk contains a large dose of calcium which helps fight osteoporosis and prevents fractures. It is also found to have a low incidence of heart disease, hypertension and stroke, which help keep us healthy. It can also help keep the blood pressure stable and reduce cholesterol levels. The study also shows that a dairy- enhanced Mediterranean diet was much superior to a low- Fat Diet for improving health, especially in terms of improving the heart health and cognitive function.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Two studies published in December will identify three potential radiopharmaceuticals that may help to speed the discovery and diagnosis of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, which has no definitive diagnostic test but remains difficult to diagnose in actual humans. The team is working to make Tau PETs more available and use them more frequently in clinical studies, in part because they have the potential to improve imaging quality by watching tau tangles in the brain more quickly and at a higher resolution than standard brain PET scans do, and could provide a more efficient way to test for Alzheimer's in the clinic and in trials to develop drugs that target those proteins in an effective way. The findings were published online by the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, in a study published as the cover story of a special issue on \"Radioactive Tau Molecules: Potential for characterization of tau tangles and development of new treatments.\" The paper, \"Tau PET molecular profiling: Three promising radiopharmaceutical compounds in Alzheimer's treatment and prevention\" is co-authored by Dean Wong of Johns Hopkins University, Robert S.

            "Summary Generated:-A new minimally-invasive surgical technique helps to prevent the life-threatening condition from coming back up and spreads faster, allowing people with aneurysms to return to everyday activities without having their lives interrupted by a risky operation that is often required. The procedure, called a carotid stent graft, has already been successfully performed on several patients in Cedars-Sinai’s Vascular Surgery department and Azizzadeh, a leading authority in the use of new technologies, has served as principal investigator on the study that showed this device could be safely used for treating aneurysms in patients with very old or otherwise weak arteries that connect the body’s major veins to its coronary arteries, making surgery easier and safer for both parties. “I am thrilled to have been able to successfully perform this new procedure for these patients and I am proud to be one of the first doctors to use the new stent graft, which is the only device on the market to help treat an aneurysm at this point, without the invasive procedure that has been traditionally associated with this particular condition,” Azizzadeh said.\n",

The results are expected to be presented next year in a scientific journal, which may have a huge influence on how we diagnose, treat, and prevent this disease that has an estimated impact on up to half of all people living in Spain, but has little awareness of its cause or cures. The research was carried out on rats used in a study on the symptoms of fibromyalgia, in which researchers used a standard diet supplement to see if it could help the condition in patients, but it seems as though there is a greater benefit for them to take aqueous extract from the leaves of this species, which is a plant native to the tropics of the Americas and can be cultivated in the AMAZON area, where this tree is endemic, and in which it has a long history and a well known medicinal role for pain reduction, infection prevention and immune system enhancement. The consumption of this traditional drug could be a step towards treating this chronic, debilitating disorder, as well as a way of reducing the severity of its symptoms.\n",

The study was described today on the sidelines of the 66th annual International Allergy &Rhinology congress in New Orleans. The work, led by researchers from the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, could help those who have lost the ability to smell by stimulating nerves in their noses with electrodes, a process that can be performed using other devices, including a cochlear implant. “The idea behind this is that we would have an implant that sends the odor back into the nose, where it would reach its original sensory receptors and allow people to regain the smell that is lost when a damaged or injured part of the olfactory system becomes damaged or damaged, and that may be a good thing because there is a huge market for this type of device, which is not yet available to the general public, especially since it has such limited functionality, so it might have advantages over other devices, including those already in use, such as cochlear implants.

The finding may help doctors monitor older patients before they suffer the disease, which is incurable but can be treated early with drugs or by undergoing treatment at a hospital. The study appeared Sunday, Nov. 25, on the cover of Annals of Neurology, a publication of The American Society For Radiology. It's the first time MRI-based biomarkers have been studied as a preventive tool against dementia and could have wide applications in Alzheimer's treatment, according to researchers. They say that MRI scans may someday help identify patients with dementia before they develop memory impairment, which could help doctors better assess and manage patients' symptoms and provide early detection of the disease, which can be diagnosed with traditional screening tests including PET scans, cognitive exams, and even tests for a genetic risk of Alzheimer's. \"Our study shows that MRI Brain Scans Are Predictable to Determine Dementia Risk 2.6 Years Before Dementia Is detectable, and could help predict dementia years in advance, which would allow for more timely diagnosis of dementia and earlier treatment, and better treatment, in some patients, especially those with dementia,\" said Cyrus Raji, lead author of the report. \"Our findings suggest that using MRI scans could eventually help doctors detect dementia decades early, allowing them to take appropriate action before symptoms strike.\"\n",

The test may also be suitable for testing in healthy controls and could be used as a screening tool for women with other cancers, such as breast, lung, and brain tumors, says the team, with the potential for use in all cancers except for melanoma, which has been found more often in people with genetic mutations than in others, including cancer of the ovaries. The test will be further investigated by scientists and clinicians to understand how to make and use it, but the new technology is very much in the early development stages and there are still a number of hurdles before it is commercially available, says Professor Michael Jennings from Griffith's Institute of Biophysical Research.

(October 16, 2018-- NIH scientists say hot water bath baths may increase the production of cytokines, a type of chemical found in cells, which may be an alternative to exercise and lower inflammation in sedentary, obese people. Researchers have shown that high-heat baths may reduce inflammation and insulin levels at rest, but they're unclear how much benefit hot water immersion will have in improving blood sugar levels in obese people, or what happens after the immersion session. The results may help explain why hot water baths have become increasingly popular among bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts and others who want to feel great, stay slim and feel great, but are reluctant to take part in exercise due to the possibility of uncomfortable and uncomfortable experiences, the researchers said. But the study doesn't yet prove hot water baths help with diabetes, because the men's fasting blood sugar did not change after hot water immersion, but their insulin sensitivity was better than during a control trial. The results also suggest hot water immersion can improve inflammatory and blood sugar levels in overweight men. However, these findings are still in early clinical trial stages, and there is no way to know for sure whether hot-water immersion will help improveInflammation, BloodSugar & insulin sensitivity in sedentary, overweight men; Study published ahead of print in Journal of Applied Physiology\n",

This treatment may have the potential to change the standard of care for prostate cancer and may even help some patients escape the negative effects that such procedures often bring to men with prostate cancer, especially in men with high-risk profiles, including those with prostate cancer diagnosed within the last decade who are on Provenza and other traditional treatments, or are already on radiation and radiation therapy, which are both more complicated and time consuming and may be harmful, but which have never before been tested using these nanoparticles. This new treatment is being conducted in Houston, which has an excellent track record in prostate research and is a great place to find the latest in medicine and science, which means it's well-positioned to offer this treatment to patients around the country, especially in communities that are less urban and have a much more diverse population, which can make diagnosis of cancer harder for experts and doctors to identify, but could mean better treatment options for those who live in urban centers and have a high risk of disease.\n",

The study, which included two patients, is being published in Nature Medicine, and researchers say it could be evaluated in further trials to treat the common side effects from immunotherapy, such as increased sensitivity to antibodies, which is seen when patients continue ICIs after a certain amount of time, or to stop them for longer periods, when they are unable to fully restore their body’s own natural defense system against the antibody-blocking drugs, which have been associated with toxicities, including infection. “These findings are exciting because we think that this is a safe, quick therapy, that can last long time, that can help people, who are very sick, even with chronic conditions, to have a healthierColon, which is why we used this technique in the first place to treat this particular type of colitis, which has such a high rate of relapse,” explained senior researcher Yinghong Wang. “This study suggests that fecal microbiota transplants are worth exploring in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy, which could be a game-changer in treating people with severe colitis.

The study found that women were found to have high-grade precancerous growths in all of those tested; more testing could improve screening access and lower costs, the researchers say, because it's possible to return the test kit to find HPV after it has gone away, which could reduce its risk of recurrence by more than 99 percent. Cervical cancer is the number one cancer-related disease that kills US women aged 10 to 65, and most cancers occur in older women, the study found. Cervical cancer is also a leading reason women don't get recommended Pap tests for cancer. More than 3,000 women die from the disease in the United States annually. Women can receive HPV screening for free or for a small fee at some health care facilities, but it is often hard for women to take the time for a trip to a clinic, so women need to be screened sooner, too.\n",

The findings suggest people may have a better chance of living longer if they are consuming these products less, says Jessica Lack, from Harvard University in Boston. \"It's encouraging to see that these fermented products may have such a big positive health benefit, and it is important for men to eat these products less, but there is more to be done to make them healthier, especially in the food industry, where it remains relatively unclear whether or not they have any benefits for consumers,\" Lack says. A new report published on Friday in Nutrition suggests a link between fermented dairy foods and improved heart health. According to a new study published on Thursday in the Journal of the European Society of Clinical Oncology, eating a small daily dose of fermented foods like cheese, yoghurt and sour milk can help lower cholesterol levels. The study followed 2,000 men from 1984-1989 in Finland to examine the links between different dietary patterns, lifestyle and health issues, and how their dietary habits were associated with their risk of heart attack and stroke.

The new finding could change how people with advanced prostate cancer choose the option to fight the disease, and what they get in return, says the team of Philadelphia researchers who studied the patients for more than 10 years at Jefferson Health and at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. \"This study is a big deal for prostate cancer patients everywhere, and it has implications for medical care for all men with cancer. The results are particularly important for patients living in communities that suffer the worst from the disease, but may be overlooked by the general health care system,\" said one of the researchers. \"For these men, who are often too weak or too fat, a prostatectomy, a less aggressive method of treating prostate cancer is often considered less effective.

With this test, pediatricians can detect and monitor the changing gut microbiome in as few as one day, which could provide parents with immediate and accurate testing for a number of issues, including eczema, IBS, colic, allergies and obesity, and prevent infants from becoming ill or developing chronic health conditions like asthma, allergies, and heart attack and stroke. \"Evoli is committed to bringing new, innovative solutions to the millions of parents and doctors who are struggling with how to help babies grow up healthy, well and fit into their wheelchairs,\" says Daniel DeCarlo, Evivo's Chief executive officer. \"This test is a game changer, and now we're ready to take on the rest of the market. We're looking forward to bringing this breakthrough product to the market later this year.\"\n",

In this latest study, researchers used the Zika virus to attack GSCs grown in lab dishes and mice model of the disease. This could help develop new treatments for this lethal cancer and even a cure for people living with glioblastoma, says lead researcher Pei-Yong Shi of UTEP's Galveston medical campus, who is studying the virus with his collaborators from Beijing's National Center of Biomedical Analysis. \"Our research may help advance new treatments, which may someday lead to better diagnosis and better treatments for people who face this deadly cancer, says Shi. We're thrilled with how we got there and the way we are using this promising vaccine in humans to try and find new ways to prevent or even treat these terrible tumors,\" says Man. \"We are hopeful that by developing this vaccine we will be able to develop better treatments and even acure for these terrible brain cancers, which can be extremely fatal.\" The Zika vaccine is safe and effective in mice, and is shown to work against other viral infections, but was not well known to be safe against cancer cells. The team has developed a vaccine that is liveattenuated to the Zika virus, and is much easier to inject than its older version. The next step is testing the vaccine on humans.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-New test can detect disease early and offer hope in the fight against it, which could be second deadliest type of cancer globally, reports research by Swedish scientists. The test is still only able to detect pancreatic cancer, while the possibility of surgical intervention exists, but the process may be much easier than traditional testing, which can be difficult in people with no underlying medical conditions or are not well suited to the patient's current lifestyle, the researchers say. Pancreatic cancer is still one of the most difficult illnesses to detect, and is still considered an 'endless' disease with few treatments, especially for patients with mutations of immune system genes that are active during the development of pancreatic cancer. A new test developed by Swedish researchers can identify the disease at earlier, more treatable stages, which could give hope to patients whose disease is still unable to be fully treated, but who may not be ready for conventional treatment or who have no existing treatment options. The test consists of dozens of antibody-rich fragments on which markers are selected based on how they match the immune systems response to tumours, including tumour-promoting antibodies, proteins that are produced by the bodys own immune system, and cancer-associated antigens\n",

This could also improve safety for the patients, as the artificial intelligence could identify and correct any errors that might have been made over the course of the drug course, allowing for a safer and more effective treatment, says a research paper published in Science Translational Research Journal, published by the US National Human Cancer Research Commission (USNRC) on 17 October 2015. It is the first clinical use of the CURATE.AI platform, an innovative AI platform designed by a team of NUS researchers. The findings may have wide-reaching effects for patients with cancer, who face many of the same challenges that humans do, but who often struggle to get the correct dose of their treatment and respond to it effectively, especially when they're alone and have very different responses to chemotherapy or radiotherapy than other people, says the team of scientists who worked at NUS in collaboration with pharmaceutical company BristolMyers Squibb, which is currently collaborating on the research. \"With these findings we believe our AI platform could revolutionise the way personalised cancer treatment is given and delivered.

The scans, called CT guided management, allowed doctors to check for blockages inside the heart more easily and in a shorter time period than tests done to prevent heart attacks. The findings show the scans are cheaper, faster and easier to do than other tests, which means they are more often used in patients who need to receive more treatment than would be expected if the tests had not been carried out. The results have been hailed as a big breakthrough, as they suggest routine chest scans can provide a much quicker and cheaper alternative to costly invasive tests that may lead to additional procedures or require surgery in the long term, reports the Daily Telegraph's health service team in Glasgow. It is not known whether this is a direct result of the scan finding, but scientists are hoping it will help lead to better use of the scans and could help to reduce costs of treatment, too, the researchers say. The research, which tracked 4000 patients in Scotland who were treated in hospitals over five years, is presented at a conference in Munich today.\n",

The study, published in Science, was based on data from thousands of female pregnant women in the U.S. The researchers also analyzed data from men who developed gestational diabetes during their later pregnancies, which is not related to diabetes in pregnant women. The results suggest that early screening, even during the third or fourth trimester, might be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for diabetes, particularly if they already have diabetes or obesity, the study's authors write. They also say that the findings don't represent the whole picture, including how other pregnancy tests might be used to improve the health of women and infants in the womb, or to identify people at high risk for developing diabetes before it occurs. For instance, it may not be enough to know a mother has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when she is in pregnancy to know whether she will also suffer from diabetes later in life. It is possible that lifestyle changes could also help prevent or lessen the effects of gestational diabetes in early pregnancy.\n",

The research also shows that even if your body is already stressed and overworked, you may be more motivated to do something than you are because of a sense of self-confidence, increased confidence, and greater happiness, which could explain why some people feel more confident and optimistic when things are going well and others less so when they are having a rough day.\n",

Three Loyola Medicine Urology urologists and a UM doctor co-author the study that shows robot-assisted treatment is effective as traditional open treatment. The findings were not surprising given the fact that the technology is becoming increasingly common in surgeries of all kinds, including open surgeries. Robotic surgery was associated with fewer side effects, but it had a greater length of stay in the hospital. The results show that the surgical method has a high rate of success in removing cancerous bladders in patients, but still requires further clinical trials to evaluate its potential in patients with other cancers. It has also shown promise in reducing the amount of blood that gets taken from the blood system and reducing the complications from infection. But more studies are needed to find out whether the technology provides benefits for patients. \"There are no clear advantages or limitations, so these studies are important first steps toward finding out how the technology works in other settings and in cancer treatment.\" said Dr. Marcus Quek, one of the researchers. \"This study is just another step toward using robotics in more complex surgery operations, such as removing kidney or bladder tumors, but we know it's still a relatively new technology with few trials.\" Robotic surgery patients lost less blood than their counterparts, but they also had a higher incidence of serious infections and were worse in the operating room.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Cardiac Hybrid MRI Predicts adverse Heart Attack Risk in Patients With Coronary artery disease, A study in the journal Radiology found that patients with hybrid cardiac imaging showed a four times greater risk of a serious heart attack, even when the imaging showed evidence of angina, rather than coronary artery stenosis, on CT or single photon emission CT, as was the standard technique used in most cases to diagnose coronary artery disease, but there was a need for a more accurate, long-term approach to detecting and diagnosing coronary artery disease and providing treatment to those suffering from coronary artery disease. The study is the latest finding that shows high-quality hybrid imaging can provide significant new insights into the risk for major cardiac attacks in patients with atherosclerosis, and it also may be an efficient tool for detecting coronary artery disease early and in determining the best care, if any, for these patients. The study, which included patients who underwent hybrid imaging, is presented in an abstract in the February 23 edition of the online journal, Radiology, as a abstracts of the Proceedings of the American Academy of Neurology (PACE). The authors say the results of this study are particularly relevant for patients who are undergoing a coronary bypass procedure, because many of them are still experiencing cardiac problems years after the procedure has occurred. They suggest that hybrid imaging may be useful for determining what therapy a patient should take, whether they should undergo bypass surgery, how often they should have bypass surgery, and if they should take a certain medicines, such as aspirin and statins.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-This study is among the first to validate a Liquid Biopsy Test' s capability to Predict Response and Provide Survival Information, which could improve patient care and prolong life, through decision-point management. This test can now help predict who will respond better to therapy and who will die, making treatment more efficient and providing more choices for physicians to make at each step of cancer care, and potentially saving lives in patients who are most likely to benefit, according to a recent article in JAMA Oncology. The blood test called, Onco type DX ® AR- V7 Nucleus DetectTM has been commercially available in the U.S. throughEpic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. \"The ability to accurately predict a cancer's response is crucial in the future for patients with advanced cancer, as it may provide a way for physicians to better choose the treatment that is most appropriate to treat their patients. We are excited to help advance this new treatment paradigm, helping to make prostate cancer better treated, while also improving the quality of life and safety of patients who have had a long, painful struggle to fight this disease, which affects 1 in every 5 men in the US\"\n",

The study also found a novel metabolic process that may play a role in vaccine-based blood sugar control, as glucose consumption rises. \"The long-term results in these patients, along with the discovery of new mechanisms of action on BCG vaccine, suggest that this simple, effective and safe treatment could be available for a broad variety of people with diabetes who now lack effective treatment alternatives,\" says MGH associate professor and clinical trial senior author Denise Faustman, MD, PhD \"However, we will need further evidence from animal and other early trials to know how long-term benefit of BCG vaccine will persist, whether it is administered as a once-a-week dose, or in combination with other current treatments such as insulin injections, or in individuals who have been treated for more than five years with a lifelong treatment of metformin, which has failed to help cure their disease.

            "Summary Generated:-Scientists find a protective effect of Vitamin D levels over the range seen internationally, suggesting that optimal vitamin D levels are not only recommended, but should be above the current guidelines. The finding adds another link to the body's immune system and bolsters the evidence for the long-held notion that certain types of radiation may help reduce cancer risk, but it still remains unclear how such radiation works or how much benefit may be gained by taking it, or whether those who already get vitamin D from sunlight are more likely to benefit, given the increased time it takes for vitamin D to make it to bones. The data supports the belief that people living in areas where the sun's rays have a greater reach (like Florida, Canada and Australia) may be more vulnerable to developing colorectal cancer, and that people with darker skin than white skin have a higher likelihood of being colonized by the disease. In the absence of any new evidence about the benefits of sunshine on the immune system, doctors are continuing to advocate that people living in places where the sun is less visible, such as Cuba and Australia, stick to diets rich in fruits and vegetables, and avoid radiation. The finding is consistent with the recent recommendation by the American College of Clinical Pathologists that individuals take between 400 and 700 IU of Vitamin D per day, which could be a dietary intervention that is more beneficial for the population than existing dietary recommendations, especially for women and people who have lower bone marrow mass.\n",

The study will be presented on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in an oral presentation during a session called ‘Rational Responses to Combination Immunotherapy: Are They Necessary?’. Initial findings suggest that combination therapy may help treat this type of cancer, which accounts for 25-30% of lung cancers and has a poor overall prognosis, and that chemo alone does not help patients, said Dr. Robert Jotte, lead study author of the trial. Previous research found that chemotherapy alone can cause side effects such as weakness and anemia, which is a common complication in patients with this disease, but it does not appear to be effective against squamousNSCLC. The study also demonstrated that the combination therapy could be used in combination with prior chemotherapy for other cancers like melanoma, sarcoma, and sarcoma. The study’s finding supports the use of combo therapies and could lead to more combinations of combos, says Dr. Jotte. “We’ve seen results in other diseases, but there have been limited treatments for this type of cancer, so we hope this treatment will be a breakthrough tool for this patient.”\n",

The researchers also said that they found the device was able to assess whether a person had schizophrenia in two minutes, as opposed to the two hours used for other studies using standard methods, which is a very quick test, especially given the difficulty of assessing the mental state of people with schizophrenia, who often have difficulty completing their own assessments of mental health and who have no direct close supervision from their physician. They say that these findings may help physicians develop more accurate diagnostic procedures for this disease, which is considered the most disabling in terms of disabling disorder, but it is still unknown how such tests could be developed and used to better treat this psychiatric disorder.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-The method is a commercially available technology that detects breast cancer at an early stage, in women without risk factors. New method uses electronic nose and breath samples to determine early stages of disease in patients. The new study also shows that re-analysis of urine samples with more modern statistical methods yields 85 percent average accuracy for detection of breast cancer, which has the world's second highest incidence rate of new cancers in women behind breast cancer. The findings, which may help shorten the treatment time, are published on the heels of a recent study from Harvard University's Institute of Clinical Sciences that also showed that urine can be analyzed with commercial technology and produce results more accurately than current diagnostic screening processes for detecting breast cancer, including MRI, in women who have no known BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 BRCA biomarkers. The findings, which were published online today in Computers in Biology and Medicine, may have significant applications beyond early cancer detection, especially for patients who have not had other testing procedures like mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic Resonance imaging because of their small size. The study is published on the eve of the International Congress of Breast Surgeons, to be held in Jerusalem, Israel, April 27 – June 1, 2018.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-WSU scientists build portable diagnostic smartphone device that can be used in rural and underserved areas, where equipment and medical personnel are often unavailable. The device works like a standard lab, but costs less than a dollar. The device also helps detect infections in patients without the usual laboratory infrastructure, and it was tested with samples from more than 700 patients at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania. They are now trying to bring it to a lab for use with patients, but hope that it could one day be widely available to hospitals in remote and rural regions, especially for those who need to diagnose and treat common infectious diseases in their patients. A paper about the device's potential as an affordable, handheld, rapid, in vitro diagnostic device was published in the journal Clinica Chimica Acta. The device is a part of an ambitious project to create a mobile health device that will provide rapid and high-quality blood testing for common diseases in remote and rural areas where traditional diagnostic procedures are costly and cumbersome, making it ideal for use in health-care settings in places where existing devices cannot provide accurate tests or are limited in their range. Researchers say that by combining components from the device with computer programs to analyze colors and test samples over a variety of distances, the device may be cheaper than current tools, and could save time for doctors in remote or rural areas who have difficulty getting to their patients, where the traditional methods of diagnosing infections often are inaccurate.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Fish consumption has been associated with good cognitive health for some time, but new research indicates that this is likely due to one specific type of protein, parvalbumin, found in many different fish species. Parvalbumin may actually prevent the development of certain harmful proteins that can lead to Parkinson's disease  and it may also be helpful in keeping our immune system sharp during these tense moments, when we all need to be extra vigilant about protecting our bodies against infection. The findings appear in Nature Communications, and could provide an easy solution to those worried about being ill, as a simple addition to our diet would mean more people were consuming fish than would otherwise be the case, and could help prevent the development of diseases such as diabetes  and also improve the overall health in our body, by helping our brains to better withstand the rigors of physical activity  but how do we get it? This is the first evidence that a specific type of protein is responsible for this association, so it might be time for a major overhaul in our current diets, and possibly a shift towards a diet rich in fish.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-A kind of brain scan could help us identify healthy people from those with cognitive problems, and may offer insight into personality and other traits as well, according to new studies. The study was led by Washington University's Steven S. Petersen, who says that before we can use this type of MRI to diagnose mental disorders, scientists need to determine whether it's actually measuring something more important than how your brain looks. The results, they say, will allow for the development of a whole new generation of testing for everything from autism to schizophrenia to chronic illnesses. \"If you can show that people are more resilient when they have brain disorders,\" he said, \"then you can develop better treatment plans and reduce the need for expensive brain scans or long-term injections that are often the only tests available to treat many types of psychiatric illnesses.\" The new research, published in Neuron, used functional connectivity MRI, a type of MRI, to find that healthy people had very different brain networks from those with cognitive disabilities. It showed that there were distinct networks of brain cells that acted differently across the brain, suggesting that such a technique may have potential in diagnosing a wide range of disorders, from mental illness to Parkinson's. The finding may also help in the search for treatments for various diseases and disorders including dementia, Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, Petersen says.\n",

The new study shows expanded screening criteria could identify more diabetes patients, potentially leading to better treatment and earlier detection of diabetes, and reduce the cost of care by billions of dollars, researchers at the University of Northwestern Medicine in Chicago report today in the Journal of General Internal Medicine; the study was based on data from a nationwide sample of adult patients at five large health systems across the United States who were participating in a large, ongoing clinical trials involving nearly 6,000 patients aged 40 to 60 with diabetes. Prediabetes, the most common form of diabetes, strikes more than 10 million Americans - one out of four of them - and the condition now affects as many as 50 percent of all adults, making the disease an increasingly serious health risk for all Americans.

The implant is a novel approach to prevent HIV infection, but it is only the first step toward longer term use of the device. Scientists say this approach could have important ramifications for public health and aid in reducing AIDS-related illness and mortality, but they are still conducting further studies to see how it affects women in the sex industry who may have HIV and how it may be used as a tool in future efforts to prevent infection and mortality in people at greatest risk for infection, including those in poor, rural regions where access to condoms has been slow to reach and AIDS drugs are often expensive and not readily available or administered on a regular basis. The researchers also say that their implant could help reduce transmission of the virus among those who don't need to receive effective antiretroviral medications because most people don't experience serious symptoms from infection until a year or two following exposure, when the immune system is less active in response to infection.\n",

The findings have been published in a new study, which led to a collaboration between scientists in the UK and US, and could potentially transform treatment of patients who are losing control of their cancer because it has no longer responded to existing drugs, or because it is too toxic to traditional treatments - including some that are effective already, like Gleevec for prostate cancer and Tafa for lung cancer - which are still in clinical testing but are not now available for treating breast cancers or other forms of cancer that are becoming treatment-resistant by virtue of their ability to attack the cancer cells' own DNA and proteins, rather than the cells' own RNA, causing them to fall off and spread to distant areas, such as in bone or lung.

This study offers hope that the drug may be used in a more advanced manner, in patients who need it more and who have a history of previous treatments that don't seem to help, the researchers write. The trial, conducted in 12 cities across the nation over a 7-year period, also tested the use of paclitaxel as a second therapy for the patients. The researchers say they are considering recommending that patients be given the second drug in such trials, as it may be less toxic than other current treatments and has been shown to be more effective in preventing the spread of some breast tumors, which are often more virulent and more resistant than uterine cancers. The results of the trial, which is due out in the spring, were published on March 27, in the journal Journal of Clinical Oncology; the researchers say they will publish more findings about the drug later this year.\n",

The researchers wanted to assess whether an app could be a useful addition to a typical care package for menstrual pain and, if so, how much it might cost to implement. Acupressure was the most effective treatment group in this study, reducing menstrual pain by up to 50% compared to usual care - but not pain medication or hormonal contraception. The authors conclude: \"Our study shows that app-based interventions for menstrual pain are less painful than traditional treatments and they can be implemented quickly and effectively, with very high success rates. This may be because it allows for real-time monitoring, which allows users to track progress and compare data over time. This is important because we know from past research that the use of self-care is often overlooked by many healthcare providers, even when such methods are used for a specific cause or condition.\" The authors also write: \"We wanted to determine what would make a good app, and whether we should consider introducing app-based self-care for other conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol, but our findings show that there's a market for apps for these problems.\" The study was conducted from 2013 to 2014, using 221 participants, with 221 receiving app updates and 221 receiving regular reminders.\n",

It's easy, noninvasive, and helps to keep migraine sufferers from having them. Migraine pain and headaches are common but are not treated, making treatment very difficult for patients and their doctors. Migraine attacks occur about 10 times every year and can be very severe. Migraine pain and headaches can also cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness and weakness. <n> <n>For those who do suffer from migraines, treatments often fail because they have no effective mechanism for control of migraines, and they are difficult for doctors to treat. But using a TMS device could help some patients treat migraines, too, if it works with other medications that are already approved for treating migraines, Dr. Starling says. For example, there are oral medications like dihydroerstamine that can reduce headache frequency, but the drugs can have side effects, and patients sometimes take them while still having migraines, which means they are vulnerable to other side effects such as vomiting and nausea. <n> <n>Spring TMS has already received FDA approval to treat migraine with aura, and it now is used to treat migraines with aura. The device does not have to be worn, but patients should keep it in a pocket and keep it in a pocket on your desk in your kitchen or at work in the bathroom every day - or at home on the stove in the kitchen, in the kitchen you'd know, or may already know, but it's well used.\n",

The vaccine is now in its third stage of human trials. Shingrix is given at the same dose as standard vaccines for those over 70. It protects against the infection and is recommended for people aged between the ages of 68 to 69. It is also offered to those aged 50 to 60. But some people over 70 have a very high risk of the condition and may not be well able to tolerate the vaccine, or may not respond to it adequately, causing side effects that include tingling and pain. This is because Shingrix is a protein made from one type of virus and not a weakened one, which means the vaccine stimulates more of the same kind of cells called T-cells that protect you against disease. Researchers from the University of NSW, Australia said that they were seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations, like those for diphtheria, polio and measles, which last about ten years on average -- but that this one lasts longer. \"Our study suggests that this therapy could be used for as much as four years of protection.

In previous research, they found that a channel in the immune cells involved in rheumatoid Arthritis is essential for their health and that the current treatment for the disease only works on a portion of these cells. The current treatments are based on drugs that are injected or injected by a physician. These medications are associated with side effects and sometimes require a patient to take an injection. The current treatments target a different portion of this body type, and the new scorpion venom treatment seems to work better, Beeton says. scorpion venom may aid in treating rheumatoid arthritis\n",

The study, which looked at older people who had been evaluated every year, is being presented at an upcoming meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, the national organization that oversees clinical studies of drugs, medical devices and vaccines. \"Our findings suggest that people who eat a diet of less fat-laden foods, like fruits, vegetables and fruits and cereals, may be in a good position to avoid the depression associated with obesity, but that we still have to figure out how to best use the nutrition facts that come with the foods we eat to prevent depression, such as maintaining healthy weight, exercising regularly and eating right,\" Cherian said. The study is the latest of many published reports linking certain diets to lowering depression, a common condition that's been shown to cause aging--and some health problems -- including memory loss, dementia, and stroke. It's a key finding, because researchers are still uncertain what exactly is in these foods that helps keep people depressed.\n",

The Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but it's not known whether a low-calorie, low-fat, Mediterranean diet will be better than a vegetarian diet in lowering the risk, the authors said. Authors say the study results show there are similar risks with different diets, so the findings should be considered when advising patients about the type of diet to consume, their risk factors for cardiovascular problems and the type of weight loss needed to achieve healthy levels of weight, or if a person has existing health issues like obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, and is not on a healthy weightloss regimen, such as a vegetarian diet, or who are already obese and have other heart-health concerns, such as hypertension, to those who are on the Mediterranean diet.\n",

The study also found that women who got DWI had a 70 percent lower false positive result than did women who got mammography. The findings have the potential to reduce unnecessary breast biopsies in women, researchers said. \"It might be useful in a larger study, where we'll test its accuracy in a much larger population of women,\" said co-lead author Paul Jaeger of Heidelberg's German Cancer Research Center. The researchers are awaiting the outcome of further trials on the new technique, which is still being tested in human clinical practice, before announcing it as a treatment alternative for suspected breast cancer or early cancer detection in women who have already had an MRI exam but were deemed to be disease-free or free from disease, or are at risk of disease and who do not want their breasts reanimated, or for those women who have already had a mammogram who have an imaging test that is inconclusive or does not offer a good alternative for diagnosis of cancer, such as a colonoscopy, or for determining whether they are healthy enough to continue their regular physical activity or undergoing other life-long activities, according to the report. The results appear online today in the journal Radiology.\n",

The test can help reduce unnecessary neuroimaging tests and potentially saving the health care system more money in the process, as the test can help reduce the time taken to screen for a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, which can result from a traumatic head injury. The FDA is currently reviewing applications for approval of blood tests to diagnose chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiac arrest and high blood pressure. For immediate release: March 12, 2015 The FDA announced plans to begin reviewing applications for drugs and biological devices for conditions including heart disease and cancer, and it issued a statement on March 1, 2015, urging the agency to “take action on an application to approve a drug to help detect serious heart disease in people with no existing treatment options” if it can prove its effectiveness. The FDA is working to ensure that patients who have cardiovascular disease are examined using blood tests to evaluate their risk for heart attack and stroke, and that those with hypertension are tested for blood pressure drugs, among other drugs and biological markers, as well. A recent FDA analysis showed that fewer than one-in-three patients diagnosed with heart disease have received any of the therapies recommended for treating them, and nearly three-quarters of patients have never received any treatment. The results are being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency recently published a paper on the issue and the results show that most patients don't suffer any side effects from a common form of injury, but experts still recommend the findings are outdated.

            "Summary Generated:-The new test can accurately diagnosis the brain diseases in less than two days, potentially giving patients early access to medical care, and helping scientists better develop treatments for Parkinson’s and Lewy bodies, which have a pathological process that resemble prion disease in the brain in mammal brains. It also provides the potential for more rapid testing of patients for neurological diseases, which is an especially important development since it allows for early identification of potential clinical trial candidates. The National Institutes of Health, which developed the rapid assay, is currently developing it as an easy-to-read test that can detect multiple neurological diseases in a patient s own blood and urine in about one minute, much faster than previous methods, which required samples from more than 20 patients. The test was modified by scientists from several NIH institutes and others to correctly identify the two disorders in spinal fluid and detect them quickly, which could reduce the number of tests needed and improve the accuracy of diagnosing and treating the diseases. The finding is a promising step toward the development of a faster, more accurate way of identifying people with Parkinson’s and dementia, two diseases which affect millions of Americans. Parkinson’s can affect about one in ten Americans. Lewy bodies can cause similar progressive brain deterioration and are responsible for cognitive impairment and other cognitive problems in people who develop them.\n",

A recent study found medical cannabis therapy significantly reduces the pain patients report, especially when used to manage chronic conditions like cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTS), making this a good addition to an existing treatment option. The results of the six month long study are reported in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Association (JGA) and published in the August issue of the journal's Clinical Research Institute (CRIM) -- which includes studies of medical cannabis therapy on a large scale. The authors write that \"after six months of treatment, the pain was significantly down, the quality of life improving and some patients were using less of their opioid drugs than had been prescribed in previous studies, which is welcome news given the large and growing demand for cannabis among older people and other groups with chronic diseases such as arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia and other ailments. The findings are exciting and will help doctors and medical cannabis users make decisions about which treatment options to consider in order to achieve optimum benefit while maintaining healthy levels of happiness and quality of life. The findings come as medical marijuana remains illegal in many states, but the movement is expanding rapidly as more medical marijuana providers are setting up dispensaries, and as the number of recreational marijuana users in the U.S. grows by around 20 million every year.\n",

The finding was reported atACTRIMS Forum, a scientific conference for research into MS and other neurological diseases, at which researchers presented more than 60 abstracts from over 400 trials involving drugs used to fight MS. The research included patients exposed to the virus John Cunningham virus that can be fatal in its most severe form, but not all patients with the MS disorder are exposed to the JCV-positive antibodies required to use the treatment, or they are not on the medication themselves. The data from the study supports that patients who are not exposed to the JCV virus may be treated with the natalizumab drug, but it's unclear what effect extended dosing schedules for the medication would have on other aspects of the treatment, especially the duration of treatment and effectiveness, which can be variable. The findings suggest that extending natalizumab dosing may help protect patients against this rare disease, and that this could mean that more patients will get to benefit from this important treatment.\n",

The pump has been used for more than two decades to provide blood transfusions to elderly or sick patients waiting for kidney transplants. It may have benefits for those waiting for an organ transplant, and for patients waiting for a donor kidney who can survive this long, says Dr. Markus Selzner, lead surgeon for this study, and a transplant expert at TIFFGH. “This is the first time such an approach has been demonstrated in North America, which could change the landscape of the transplant process, and for those waiting to undergo a transplant” he explains. The kidney remains in place until it is ready for transplantation, which could be a huge milestone in the fight against waitlist congestion. This is part of a new study that is testing a technique called ‘ Ex Vivo Pneumatic Perfusion,’ or ex-vivu, that seeks to improve the long-term safety of organ transplant recipients, by using donated kidneys that would otherwise have had to be frozen or cooled. It is a method of preserving the organ in cold weather without damaging it or delaying repairs. The procedure takes about two days. The study is in its early stage and not expected to reach its final stage for another five years, although it has already been used for other types of transplants, and has already been used on humans.

            "Summary Generated:-The study is the latest to explore the potential of DTI reconstruction, which has become more prevalent in the face of cancer treatment in older patients, to be used in elderly women with less risk of cancer and other health issues. The findings, which were presented at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons meeting in New York City, may provide new reasons for older women to choose DTI over other options, including more invasive, multi-step procedures that can have more of an inconvenience and risk, such as drains, blood transfusions, infection and failure. The researchers believe that older women, with better health and other medical factors, are more likely to avoid or delay having a breast reconstruction. They also believe that using DTI, rather than other treatments like TEI, can help reduce hospital time and infection risks, and that women in this age group will have a better quality of life after surgery if they stick with reconstruction, regardless of whether it succeeds. The researchers concluded, \"While DTI has emerged as a safe and effective choice, there are significant drawbacks, including increased risks, associated with this surgical technique, which makes it worth considering for older patients, particularly in those who don't have many other options, including more invasive multi-step procedures that have a greater impact on overall quality of life than do other surgical options.\"\n",

The findings may have major health implications for communities and dentists, the authors of the report note. It's a key to improving dental health for our community and for our health as a country, the authors say, and it could dramatically improve the quality of life for many young people who use drugs and alcohol or take other medications to control their appetites and avoid sugar and carbohydrates. The results could also have important health and economic impact for communities, because fewer cavities, and fewer patients with caries are going to have to get treatment for the condition, which affects about 50 million Americans. The report, 'CamBRA? Assessment, Management of caries risk and preventive measures to reduce cavities' is published on Jan. 22, 2018, in advance of the American Economic Forum's annual convention in San Francisco. The findings are similar to ones that had been shown in previous trials using this method to prevent or treat tooth decay in young adults and teenagers. The results are similar in how patients used prescription products to reduce their risk, but the results were different for the people who took medicines. The researchers said that the patients in the control group were also at much reduced risk for cavities because they were less exposed to certain kinds of drugs and alcohol.\n",

The findings show that smartphones and other digital devices can help surgeons better identify and monitor surgical injuries, helping to improve the chances of success, avoid complications, and reduce the number of hospital admissions, among other benefits. In 2014, the percentage of Americans hospitalized for wound care complications was nearly four times that of those with other infections, making wound care the most important post-surgery care. The study showed that the apps were able to accurately identify wounds in patients more quickly, which allowed surgeons to detect complications early, allowing earlier intervention, leading to faster and less costly care.\n",

It is a promising development, but researchers are still looking at whether it can improve arterial stiffness among healthy adults, and whether it may even be effective for preventing cardiovascular disease or preventing fatal heart attack. In this study participants had arterial stiffness in four months of taking 4,000 international units every day - the recommended dose of the vitamin - compared to placebo. In the final month after the first month, participants reported that they were feeling better - and more comfortable - with their arterial stiffness. They did not develop any cardiovascular problems, and they also had less severe chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes and colon cancer that are more common than many people think, including those in the study's subjects.

            "Summary Generated:-A study involving 12,000 older women suggests that a simple questionnaire can help detect osteoporosis and reduce the number of hip  breaks in older women by 28%, with more screening of women who were deemed at highest risk of breaking a hip than would be done in regular GP <n> practice, says a University ofBirmingham researcher, who was involved in the collaboration between seven universities in Britain, has published in the Lancet.

The results may help people who spend an excessive amount of time sitting at work or on their desks, but it is not clear how to change behavior without changing the way we work, the study authors said. “The goal is not to just create a desk environment that is pleasant and comfortable for you, but to improve the environment that you live in, including your diet, your sleep and your ability to focus,” said study senior author Craig HorsWill of the University of Illinois at Chicago. “If it’s possible to change how we do that, it can make a difference, and we are trying to find the best solutions to help our students and other workers get more exercise, but the most important is to keep track of how much time you are sitting at the desk and the number of hours you spend in your chair. We have been researching ways to change sitting patterns in the workplace in recent decades, but there is no solid proof that these techniques actually work as well as previous experiments showed they did. These studies should give us some hope for the future,” said Horswill. In a few years, researchers hope they can create new devices that will help users sit down more and keep up.

The results were seen among non-Hispanic whites and Chinese Americans; researchers found that although Chinese women do eat more soybeans and soy foods than white women do, their diets differ, and therefore are not likely to be a contributing factor to the association between the two. The study, which involved nearly 200 women, is one of the most significant efforts to determine how dietary habits relate to side effects during treatment, and whether lifestyle behaviors, such as eating a healthy diet and quitting unhealthy habits, are also linked to better quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The study also examined the associations of soy and cruciferous vegetables with fewer symptoms and fewer fatigue symptoms. The results were not seen in the benefit for white breast cancer survivors, who typically consume soy foods and soy vegetables, researchers explain.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Researchers say marijuana may slow HIV’s mental decline, which has been linked to brain damage and decline in mental health, by inhibiting inflammation on white blood cells that attack the brain. The compounds in marijuana may reduce these cells and slow down the immune system’s fight-back against disease, which can have an effect on how mental health is affected by HIV, Norbert Kaminski, lead author of a study on the drugs published this week in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, and his grad student co-author Mike Rizzo, say they are confident that the drug could eventually become a treatment for some patients with HIV and other disorders. “This study shows that the drug may slow down inflammation in the body – something that could ultimately have effects on cognition and mood in HIV patients who have mental decline due to inflammation,” Kaminski says. “It’s possible that marijuana may slow down those inflammation and that it may affect the mental process in some of the people with HIV, helping them remain focused and have good mental function, which may lead to a longer life after HIV infection and better chances of survival. It is important to understand exactly how marijuana acts on immune cells, and what role marijuana might play in altering those cells. In fact, we know it plays an important role in binding to receptors that bind to receptors on the surface of some immune cells, so this research could help explain why marijuana affects the immune system and possibly others as well\n",

The results are said to be remarkable, with a majority of patients having no pain after a single session of treatment and no patient requiring surgery after two treatments. The treatment used is called the pulsed radiofrequency procedure; it has previously been found to be safe, effective and to be less invasive than conventional methods for treating the condition, such as surgery.

A randomized trial of this alternative screening has shown its benefit to asymptomatic women who request supplemental screening when traditional methods fail to detect cancer or are not necessary. The American Cancer Society Guidelines recommend only a mammogram in these patients who are healthy and have a family history of cancer or other forms of cancer, but this test may be more efficient and effective because of the potential benefits to the woman and the test itself, say researchers at the Penn Medicine School of Radiology. The results of this research were recently reported in a paper published in the Annals of Radiology, one of the premier scientific journals in the world, and appeared ahead of their expected release in the next two months.

The results of the new work could provide new hope to the many people who have tried and failed diets to control obesity. \"It seems that there might be something that can be done that's not as controversial as taking drugs that are already part of the traditional treatment plan for this problem, but is still relatively simple to do,\" he said. \"It has a similar kind of taste to a cinnamon spice so we think it would have a fairly good flavor profile, which is something we can do with other spice treatments in this area that are popular in the industry.

A new study shows clot removal is better than standard therapies after a stroke -- even if done hours after stroke symptoms end, as many stroke patients who can afford clot-busting medications might prefer. The findings could have far reaching benefits for those who would rather avoid the costly and lengthy recovery process required with standard clot-fighting drugs, but also could help doctors and nurses treat more stroke patients who have already been hospitalized and may be suffering from post-stroke symptoms, such as aphasia, or chronic pain, that may be caused by brain injury or neurological damage. The study, entitled 'DWNT trial: Thrombectomy for Stroke,' was randomly conducted and enrolled 206 patients with severe or moderate stroke in six centers in Japan, China and the United States, all in Tokyo, with an average duration of two years of hospital stay of less than one year. The results, to be presented today in San Diego, CA at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, show that clot removing within 24 hours after the start of stroke caused significant reduction in disability in patients with severe stroke. The finding is a milestone in the ongoing quest to better treat stroke, which affects around 40 million people worldwide, and may offer a way to lessen the need for expensive and costly therapy, researchers say.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Cervical screening can be used together to reduce the costs of screening. But a new paper finds that HPV testing won’t tell you whether your precancerous lesions are HPV-related, and it can’t be used alone. So women should get HPV screening only if they have a history of STDs or a certain type of infection; if they have never had any sexual partners, do not have HPV vaccination and should not be told they must get a Pap smear on their own before starting HPV vaccine. The study’s co-author says the best option is HPV screening alone, with Pap smears only as an additional tool for early detection. But women should have their own tests and be given HPV vaccinations every five years, and then the Pap smear once per five years if they are healthy. The main problem: The HPV test has not yet proved effective at finding precancerous cells, which has raised concerns that testing for cervical cancer can be overused and results in too little detection of cancer, and that the tests are costly and not effective enough to be worth the risk of false positives.\n",

The discovery could lead to a new class of commercially viable antibiotic that can be made using simple techniques and could potentially be developed into a treatment for patients who are currently not effective against bacteria such as MRSA and drug-resistant pathogens such as C Nile and Kelch aureus. It is also a step forward towards creating a new class of antibiotics which are just as effective at killing bacterial pathogens without being resistant to drugs already in circulation, including some widely used drugs like antibiotics like rifampeh and medecidyl 1,2,3-fluorometracycline (Medecida dihydrochloride or MCPE). The University of Lincoln has led the effort in developing this breakthrough and hopes that it will allow them to produce more easily the drugs which many believe are essential for the future fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as MRSA, and which are a major source of death in people living in developed countries.\n",

The results were especially surprising because most of the participants in the study had never tried weight-training programs, and they had a very difficult time sticking to the regimen. The study also looked at how well older adults with obesity performed over time on certain types of fitness activities.

It is used to detect breast cancer in patients who cannot feel their breast and can't undergo invasive procedures like lumpectomies, or those who have no alternative but to biopsy the cancerous lump to determine its origin. Rush University Medical Center is the first Chicago-based hospital to be approved by FDA to sell the system, which can be used within a week before or weeks before the surgery to help avoid complications that can cause the incision to be made too early or the surgeon to miss any necessary information that would indicate a suspicious lesion might have escaped the original location. SAVI SCOUT is not used on patients whose breast tumors are located elsewhere in their body or where a biopsy could be done earlier. The SAVI SCout radar reflector uses ultrasound to identify the abnormality before the operation, which allows the radiologist to place the device before surgery instead of waiting days or weeks after the operation to insert the wire. Unlike lumpectomy, a lumpectomy does not remove the breast itself; it removes cancerous tissue. Because of this, it’s important that a radiologist find the abnormal area in advance and the procedure is quickly planned to eliminate the possibility of long waits, long procedures, long recovery period, and even longer biopsies, making it possible to achieve a successful outcome in a matter of minutes or even a minute.

The results show that such fasting -- which involves no calorie consumption for a period of about two weeks -- already shows benefits after only six weeks, even if it is interrupted for a short period. The researchers say that this new type of diet, which is similar to a low-fat diet, can actually be beneficial to our bodies by stimulating immune cells, increasing blood flow to the fats and burning fat. They say such fasting can help keep blood vessels open and fight inflammation, a process known as \" atherosclerosis\" -- a condition that affects about three billion Americans. The results of this recent study could have major ramifications for those hoping to avoid or at least avoid obesity in the coming years, as many experts now say that people with obesity would benefit from eating healthier food at a more realistic amount.

The Phase II clinical trial was funded by a grant awarded by the National Academy of Sciences and ran between 2011 and 2015 with 60 patients each. The study is the first to show a successful treatment for MS in patients who had been treated with other drugs that were proven to be effective but not effective enough to change the underlying biology of the disease or the severity of its effects, the researchers said. \"I'm really impressed with how quickly these findings came to light, because we'd never seen anything like it in the lab,\" says Ari Green, the Principal Investigator of the study. \"This could change how doctors think about MS treatment, but we know this is a long, slow process that needs to happen over many decades before it can be truly translated into real relief for patients who live with the disease.\"\n",

The researchers believe that genetic testing for warfarin may be a way to improve dosing and to provide patients and their doctors with a safer option for managing a potentially dangerous drug, which is commonly prescribed to people with heart problems and stroke. They say genetic testing may help determine which drugs are safe and effective for people with certain health issues and that it may also aid the development of new medications, particularly in patients who do not already have genetic mutations, which are thought to be the reason they are more vulnerable to dangerous blood clots, but who have not previously been studied for their gene makeup.\n",

The article, which is available online for free, shows that the extendedRelease formulation led to better ADHD results in the evening, when the children are sleeping, but that this did not have to wait for the morning, when the kids had to wait until after school, for their morning dose. \"We were excited to show that extended-release is a safe, effective and efficient means of delivering ADHD treatment, but we still do not have a proven, safe way to do that,\" says the study’s authors, who hail from several prominent medical facilities. The results of the study are now being investigated in more than 100 children with ADHD, according to a statement from the journal. \"Our study shows that ADHD medications are effective in many young people with the disorder—but we need more data to prove that these therapies are working in children and teenagers, and that the long-acting form of the medication is most effective for children, particularly those over six years old.

The results of this extensive research were recently published in a prestigious journal that is considered to be one of the premier sources for medical and scientific information, as it has been issued and published in the most prominent scientific publications of the past 50 years. The study was supported by The cranberry Institute, which is an independent organization committed to the science, research and public health of cranberries. The institute has long been a proponent of the use of cranberry products to help fight urinary Tract infections, which is one of the main reasons the industry continues to support and back the research of its own scientists. The Cranberry Institute has also been involved in numerous international and domestic studies examining the effectiveness of cranberries, including a report last year from the European Academy of Science suggesting that cranberries could be a natural treatment option for a variety of ailments and disorders such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD); the latest study supports the findings and further supports the notion of using cranberries to treat recurrent UTIs\n",

The LED device emits a narrower wavelength than sunlight and has been tested to create more vitamin D3 than sunlight. It was also successfully tested on mice for a study on cancer prevention. RayVio hopes the new findings will provide momentum to the company's plan to launch its 293nm LEDs as commercial devices within the next three to seven months. About Ray Vio RayVio's 293nm UV LED lights are capable of generating a much wider spectrum of light than other LEDs, including the wavelengths used in most smartphones and cell phone cameras. The LED lights are said to generate much faster light waves than normal LEDs and have an efficiency rating greater than 100 lumens per watt, more efficient than current light sources. Ray Vio believes its UV LED technology offers an exciting opportunity to create new treatments that could potentially have widespread applications and reduce the cost of health care. A recent FDA approval for a small device to be used as a light source to treat skin conditions and cancer patients has generated excitement among doctors and scientists and the company believes its LED will be an attractive alternative to current phototherapy products. RayVio is a leader in LED technology with a strong history of technology innovation and is using this expertise to transform the treatment of cancer and skin disorders by enabling the production of a broad array of medical devices. The company plans to commercialize its phototherapy LED-emitting phototherapy technology in the coming months.\n",

The results were presented Wednesday in a paper titled 'Antidepressant Nortriptyline, an antidepressant in use since 1967, may be effective against Parkinson's disease' and appeared on the cover of the Journal of Neurochemical Disease. The findings are the work of two neuroscientists at MSU and could eventually help doctors better treat patients who suffer from the disease and prevent progression of Parkinson's, a common, but slow- progression disorder, their researchers said. The drug is not being tested on humans yet, and there are questions about its effect on human brains but this is one more important discovery made in the effort to better understand the cause of the disease, which affects about 800,000 Americans and is the leading cause of disability for those aged 65 and older. In some Parkinson's patients, antidepressants may actually delay symptoms of the disease because they reduce dopamine, a naturally produced substance, in the brain rather than blocking it, as is common with many other neurological ailments. In a study of people who were taking levodopa or a different class of antidepressant that is commonly used, Tim Collier and Katrina Paumier found that patients on these classes of medication were able to delay treatment if they took a certain class of antidepressants, which were more effective in some cases of Parkinson's patients than others who weren't taking the drug.\n",

The single-color digital PCR test also has a low cost of use and offers advantages over other molecular tests used to screen for cancer genes, including targeted sequencing, which can be costly and complicated. The study is one of the most exciting findings that researchers have made since we have been trying to make personalized testing more available and affordable for cancer care. The report's author Hanlee Ji of Stanford University says that the test provides a potential way for cancer doctors to monitor the growth and spread of cancer patients, and thus may someday lead to a more widespread and inexpensive method for testing patient tumors. \"This new test has been truly motivated... I am proud to collaborate with Stanford Genome Technology Center on this work, which holds great promise for improving the treatment of people with cancer. The ability to screen for mutations in a single blood test could open up new possibilities in cancer monitoring, treatment and research, and may revolutionize the way we treat our friends and relatives suffering from the deadly disease. We hope that this new test will become widely used, making it an everyday part of routine medical testing for any cancer patient, from your family member or loved ones who suffers from cancer.\n",

The work could have broad implications for people who struggle with heart failure but are not yet ready for stem cell therapy, researchers say. A study published Thursday in European Heart Journal also showed that the stem cells from young rodents may help the heart of healthy older rats by producing a certain type of gene. \"These stem cells may hold the key to helping the human body age gracefully,\" said Marbn. \"If we can grow stem cells in a laboratory and test them in human patients, we might have a better chance of saving lives and preventing or even treating some serious diseases that will affect more than one in five American men and women who are over age 65 and living with or with chronic heart conditions such as heart attack or stroke.\" The findings were published as the first report in a series that will explore new ways of treating heart problems, including treating patients suffering from heart failure\n",

The research also suggests that a dietary supplement, vitamin B3, which is generally found in legumes, can improve the health of mothers, fathers and their babies. This is a great development for the unborn, particularly in Australia, where we now have proven that Vitamin B3 can actually prevent miscarriage and birth defects. The findings are now being tested on women across Australia who have been found to be genetically at high risk of miscarriage and birth defects or have already had a baby who has such a problem. If this research is successfully translated to women across Australia, there could be benefits to be felt across the nation. Here's why you should take note of these new findings: The implications of this new research are far reaching, not only will it lead to improved care for the unborn, but could also save lives, says Professor Dunwoodie. “Now we can start looking at what the effects are on the pregnant mother and baby, so we can reduce the risks and improve the health of both mother and baby. It is a very exciting breakthrough that is set to change the way pregnancy research is done in Australia,” says Professor Dunwoodie.\n",

This new technology could be used in humans and animals to grow organs and blood vessels to restore function and life, including in cases where injuries and illnesses are caused by aging or natural disasters, or if there are other causes for which repair is not possible. The technology, called Tissue Nanotransfection, was first developed at the Ohio State University College of Engineering and Wexner Medical Center. The technology is being tested in clinical settings to test its effectiveness in treating injury and stroke, but also in the treatment of aging and other diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and other diseases in which tissue regeneration and repair is most needed. The research, published in Nature Nanotechnology, is part of an ongoing project at Ohio State involving scientists in two distinct programs, one devoted to developing new and improved treatments for patients and another dedicated to studying and exploring new techniques and approaches to improve the health, well being and quality of life of people living in this country.\n",

The study, in the current issue of The journal Cancer, describes how they found the mutation and tested its effect on a promising drug called neratinib, an experimental drug that works by blocking the protein that promotes cancer cell activity. The drug is known as an oral therapy, and it is already in clinical trials in more than 30 other countries. Researchers also found that the drug could also be administered directly to cancer cells, which has the potential to provide an alternative therapy to chemotherapy or hormone therapy for many cancer patients. According to researchers, this research may open new perspectives on the use of new technology to screen patients for these mutations and to find those who carry them.

University of Iowa researchers, however, may have stumbled on the cure: natural compounds from the plants that may help patients with the debilitating condition improve their exercise tolerance, increase muscle strength and even prevent or treat the dreaded muscle-debilitating condition. The compounds have shown significant improvement in mice, and researchers believe they may have a practical application for people with cancer or other serious ailments, including heart failure and kidney disease. The patent is licensed to Innovus Pharma and it may eventually lead to an over the counter product to treat cachexia, which affects 10 percent of the adult population and costs the economy an estimated $4 billion each year because it can result in a multitude of serious side effects such as nausea, headaches, diarrhea, dizziness and blood pressure. Innovus plans to develop the drug into an OTC product that will not require prescription and it might be available for sale online or in brick & mortar stores nationwide by next year.\n",

The study was presented in a paper at the 38th International Conference on Drug Development and Research (ICADD), held from 20 to 22 June in Sydney. The findings may offer hope to elderly patients who have not benefitted from modern treatment approaches, and provide a potential new model for developing a more effective alternative to currently-used medications for depression in this population, said the researchers. \"The findings are welcome because it may allow us to expand on the current approach to treating depression with drugs like benzodiazepines and other drugs with a different flavour, which often have negative side-effects or have less effective effectiveness than ketamine.\" said lead author Professor Colleen Loo. \"Ketamine, a synthetic narcotic that's commonly used for illicit purposes, may have potential applications for treating depression in older people. \"We now need to determine if these findings can be extrapolated to other forms of treatment and use, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines such as opiates and benzodiazepines.\"\n",

The finding is a welcome news to patients as well as to doctors, who previously saw little benefit for patients treated with standard care, researchers say. Proton therapy works like a battery of tools, delivering protons directly to tumor surface to destroy cancer cells. The results were reported at five-year intervals, but the results of the study, which has not yet been translated into official findings, have been widely known since it was published a year ago, but few details have been made known about how the findings would affect patients or their health care providers. \"Our findings could help doctors better understand what is working for their patients who are facing an advanced diagnosis, how to make treatment more appropriate, and how to reduce the effects of cancer treatments on people and their bodies,\" says Chang. \" Proton therapy has proven to be highly effective against many cancers, and is proving to be a more effective method of treatment, and we're continuing to investigate its effect in other cancers and other tumors as well.\"\n",

A larger trial would be necessary to assess its effectiveness for treating eye floaters and whether it offers a safe alternative to other laser surgeries that are not recommended by the American Board of Ophthalmology because they don’t offer enough protection to the eye from damage done to the macula during the formation of the pigment layer behind the eyelashes. “This results-based trial suggests that laser surgery, which has been approved in more than 60 countries, is not only safe but can provide relief for some patients who are not comfortable having laser surgery and have floaters that can be difficult to see,” write the authors. “However, the current study does not examine whether the laser procedure has a long term effect on floaters, which may be an issue that we should further investigate when we have more patients with floaters with laser treatments to consider in the future.”\n",

They say that the results of a study released in January show the public needs to have more options when deciding whether to buy or use hearing aids. The American Medical Association says that most Americans will never get better hearing because they don't have access to these tools, so the need for new and more cost effective technologies is great, but there are no rules to help consumers choose the correct device. According to the WHO, the number of people aged 15 to 79 with hearing disorders has increased from 5 million in 1988 to 9 million today, and the numbers are only going to go up. The majority of this growth is occurring in developing countries. In Europe, some countries are even putting measures in place to limit the market of hearing aid devices, while in Asia they are growing more difficult to control, particularly as technology improves. And in Europe, it is becoming increasingly obvious that many countries do not offer a clear way to identify which devices are good and which ones aren't.

The CardioMEMSTM HF System is an innovative device that can monitor and adapt treatment for patients who may be unable to benefit from existing treatments, allowing for greater efficiency in health-care organizations, reducing the costs and increasing the life- expectancy of patients with cardiovascular conditions, particularly those who have previously been poorly cared for and who are no longer at risk for cardiovascular disease or whose conditions are no longer being properly treated, according to researchers at the Peter Munk cardiac center. “With this new tool, we'll see warning signs sooner and intervene before patients experience symptoms, and then better adjust treatment based on the data, which will help improve outcomes and prevent costly, potentially unnecessary hospital visits,” say the study’s researchers. “This is another breakthrough in heart health research that will impact the way we treat heart failure patients and improve outcomes for those living with heart failure and their families.”\n",

            "Summary Generated:-A new system that usesreflective markers to pinpoint patient location may be the future of surgery, according to Vanderbilt engineers who've built it into a coffee cap that promises to improve the accuracy of GPS devices used to guide surgery. The technology is currently only used for surgeries on the face and larynx, but the team of Vanderbilt engineers believe they have devised a way to address a major concern about the technology, and may eventually make it applicable to other surgical procedures. They hope to show that their design can improve navigation by using reflective markers rather than cameras or other software, which has proven to be a problem with some surgery systems. It's a promising step in the process of improving the reliability of GPS, but it may require some modifications, according to one of its creators. \"If we could make this device affordable, it would make surgery more effective, more comfortable for patients and less expensive to buy, because it does the work of mapping and tracking the head, which is why the system is so critical,\" said study author Robert Webster. \"We want to see how this device can improve accuracy during surgeries, not only during surgery, but in the future in other medical fields like prosthetics and even cancer surgery, so that we can better predict what happens to a body during a particular surgery.\"\n",

The study found that a partial procedure to embolize fibroids reduced the odds of pregnancy by nearly half for women with fibroids and resulted in the birth of 150 babies over six years in the study of women who had been denied pregnancy because of their fibroids; however, the results are still not conclusive for those who had not received full treatment, but researchers suggest that partial UFE may provide a much better option for women whose fibroids don't fully heal themselves and have not yet been treated with a traditional surgical approach, or for women who are undergoing IVF or who are already using other therapies to reduce their risk of infertility. \"This is the first large, prospective, long term study to compare the two treatments to determine their effectiveness and outcomes for women with uterine fibroids,\" said co-authors Dr. Pisco of Saint Louis Hospital. \"It's a big step forward for this treatment and for women with fibroids and fertility concerns.\" The findings appear in the July 13, 2013, print issue of the journal Radiology.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-A new study shows that going vegetarian could be more effective than conventional diets at reducing the number of fat cells in the body, which could lead to a healthier lifestyle. The researchers also find that going vegan is more effective at reducing the amount of muscle fat in our body than a conventional low-calorie dieting regime. The findings could have major health benefits for people with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, who may want to avoid increasing their amount of fat cells in order to reduce their insulin level, the result of which can be an unhealthy and potentially dangerous combination. The authors report that the results were similar in both the dieters and the fat storage in subjects' thighs but vegetarians showed more significant and faster reductions in subcutaneous fat than did the diabetics, suggesting that vegetarians may offer more effective means of reducing subcutaneous fat in patients with type 2 diabetes than diabetics, who are usually advised to diet with a greater percentage of vegetables and fruits in order to prevent obesity. The researchers conclude: \"In addition to improving metabolic processes,Vegetarian intake was found to be more effective in decreasing body weight and improving the ability of muscles to respond to changes in food textures, exercise and diet habits, thereby helping to improve body image, physical fitness and function.\"\n",

The discovery may have broad implications for preventing premature births, which cause fewer than 1 percent of births to be carried out prematurely. New study is published in the FASEB Journal, a leading journal on scientific research and development in the world's 30 top biomedical societies, including the American Society of Clinical Biology, the International Federation of the American Societies for Experimental Biology, the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Association for Maternal and fetal Medicine, the European Association of Pregnancy and Birth Control, the American Academy of Family and Medical Physicians and the American Academy of Child StudyTORC. The authors cite their research as the basis for the current theory that some bitter tastes make women less able to deliver infants at full term, and that this makes them vulnerable to developing preterm labor, an extremely rare condition that is more common in women than men. They also write that the discovery suggests that a bitter taste receptor located on uterine muscle might help to prevent or delay the onset of early labor in fetuses and newborns. The study also showed that if they exposed mouse fetuses to bitter substances before showing early labor, it was possible to avoid the condition and still deliver a baby in its third month of pregnancy.\n",

The findings were presented on May 19. The findings are featured in an article entitled, 'EFMT reduces depression symptoms using brain mapping' in the online journal'Journal Of Personality &amp; Social Behavior'. The authors also say that the findings support the concept that the emotional faceMemory task can help treat depressive disorders by stimulating brain cells involved in emotion control and cognitive control and rebalancing these regions by using different emotions. \"The results of the trial are a great encouraging step in the advancement of our digital therapy technology, and we hope that our technology can be applied to other psychiatric disorders, like OCD or ADHD, as well,\" said Joseph C. DeGena, PhD, of Click Therapeutics. \"This treatment may provide a new way for patients to reach out to psychiatrists, and could make a big difference to the millions of depressed people who are unable to seek help because they feel overwhelmed and don't have an effective treatment option.

The device has been developed by scientists in the Carr Institute for Health and Human Services to replace two of the most commonly used screening tests, the colposcope and the speculum. The device is available at a suggested retail price of $6 for a single use. The Duke lab developed it in collaboration with University of South Carolina's National Institutes of Health, who have been leading international efforts to develop better screening tools. Researchers believe that their invention could help save thousands of lives every year by increasing the number of diagnoses and treatment referrals that occur, saving an estimated $10 million in hospital care costs and millions of dollars in medical costs annually. The Duke/NIH-funded project aims to develop new, less invasive, less-costly technologies that can help reduce the burden of disease and prevent or treat it sooner, while providing access to affordable and reliable screening devices and other medical equipment for women living in low-income regions, where most cases of cervical cancer are detected. It is not clear how long it could be used by health care providers or whether the technology would even be necessary in low-income countries.\n",

But new research suggests a drug being developed by Eli Lily could be a promising new treatment for this common autoimmune disease, scientists said. “The findings show that a new treatment may be close,” said Robert Genovese, a scientist at the M.R. Abrams Cancer Center at George Mason University and study co- author. A large, multinational trial conducted by EliLily found that patients who were treated every four weeks with the biotech company’s drug ixekizumab, given as a single injection each, experienced fewer tender and swollen joints. In a study published online by the American Society for Clinical Immunology, the drug appeared to reduce joint stiffness and tenderness in the most severely affected groups of patients. (A similar drug was already approved in the United States for this disorder, but there has been no clear winner in the current market.) “These findings provide another important step towards treating psoriatic arthritis in a manner that does not require a lifelong medication,” said Richard H. Katz, director of the division of immunology and immunology at the Walter E. Packer Institute of Medical Sciences in Baltimore and lead author of the latest research paper. “It could be a game changer in treating the condition.”\n",

The researchers have made a super-strong version of a powerful antibiotic called vancomycin—a drug that can fight infections without making it more dangerous. The new discovery could make this antibiotic even more potent to use by physicians, while preventing the development of resistance to it. “We are closer to developing the antibiotics that we need for the future of medicine,” said co-author Dale Boger, a professor ofChemistry at TSRI who has studied how bacteria fight back against drugs and was involved in the search for this new form of the drug. “The idea that you could develop an antibiotic that could be used without fear of resistance from resistance emerged when we started our research. This is one step that we have taken to try and find the drug that would be safe for everyone to use and not cause a lot of problems if it became resistant.” The finding could lead to better drugs, which can be prescribed less and used less frequently, so doctors could focus on the most virulent kinds of infections that require the most aggressive therapy, like pneumonia. The drug would not be as effective against some kinds of deadly bacteria, including those that have developed resistance to it. “These findings are very promising, and we're very grateful for the collaboration and the support from the university and the scientific community that have aided this research,\" said co-author Robert S.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-New York University School of Medicine researchers published the results of a randomized, controlled trials that showedCannabidiol, a component of marijuana, was more effective than placebo at reducing children and adolescents' monthly seizure rates. The new study, reported online June 16 in Nature Medicine, was designed to show whether CBD would also help with other forms of Dravet syndrome, which affects an unknown number of young people who are genetically predisposed to develop the severe, progressive, and fatal form of epilepsy that afflicts more than 30 million Americans. For many people with epilepsy, this is the first time they have ever been given a new option to try to treat their seizures. The findings were a breakthrough for the medical community, which for years had debated the question of whether cannabinoids were good enough to treat seizures. But the research suggests that there are many ways in which CBD can work to treat or treat epilepsy, as well as to alleviate some other health problems, such as Crohn's Disease, AIDS, diabetes and other diseases. In a recent study on the use of marijuana to treat certain types of cancer, researchers found that patients treated with cannabis-derived chemotherapy were significantly less likely to suffer a tumor. The latest study suggests that similar results can be experienced by those treating children with a range of chronic, serious diseases such as schizophrenia, diabetes and autism. “Cannabidiol has a wide range of properties, but it does not have psychoactive properties that are known to be beneficial, and its benefits have been unknown to us...

A drug for leukemia patients that can help the patient tolerate chemotherapy may prevent allergic reactions when used with other medications, a new Northwestern Medicine study has shown. The drug ibrutinib was developed at the National Cancer Institute and is widely used to treat cancer in adults. This drug is used with other chemotherapy treatments to fight against cancer. \"Ibrutinib has the ability to do both of those things, and it's now being tested for allergy, so there are lots of possibilities for the drug to treat allergy patients, too,' said Dr. Bruce Bochner of Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine. \"It seems like it could be an important new drug in allergy therapy.\" Bochner, along with his colleagues, will soon publish their findings on the small study, which involved just two patients who had certain types of allergy and had already received other therapies for their cancers, but also had previous allergies that required testing. The patients who were exposed to cat dander or ragweed showed the lowest levels of reactivity, which may have come from stopping a protein that plays a crucial role in blood cells and other allergic reactions. The drug is approved for treating B Cell and Mantle cell lymphomas; Bochner says it's a good fit for this specific kind of cancer.\n",

The results of this small trial of 79 women who experienced hot flashes and other symptoms of post-menopausal life were published in a new journal for menopause, Menopause. In this trial, two capsules of fennel twice weekly were given to these women to treat menopause symptoms, but fennel was not effective for treating them, so they were randomly divided into three groups to administer the treatment. Fennel also seemed to help improve sleep and joint discomfort, while not increasing vaginal dryness or insomnia. The results of this small study of 79 women who experienced hot flashes and other symptoms of Post-Menopause Life were published in an online journal, Menopause. The findings were published as a randomized, Triple- blind, placebo Controlled Trial. Here is what researchers have learned about fennel and its ability to manage menopause symptoms. Fennel is a known herb to have health effects for digestion, and premenstrual symptoms, as well. This study finds that it's safe, and effective, for reducing menopause symptoms without serious side effects, and does so by increasing the level of estrogen in fennel. Here are all the details, including results of the study. The researchers say the results are consistent with other trials that found that fennel was associated with a link to higher levels of certain nutrients, but fennel was not found to actually have been linked to evidence of studies...\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Researchers at Cleveland Clinic found a new, faster, less expensive prostate cancer blood test is as effective at identifying prostate cancer as a traditional prostate cancer screening and could reduce the number of biopsies by nearly 50%. The study showed that the Iso PSA blood test is more accurate in identifying patients who need curative intent therapy and other applications, while it is more precise in detecting prostate cancer - which may mean fewer prostate biopsy's and a lower number of unneeded biopsies, according to study results, which were presented on April 19 at the American College of Physicians' 73rd Annual meeting in Atlanta. The researchers say that they plan to proceed with clinical studies and are hopeful that the test will become standard in the future, potentially reducing unnecessary biopsy procedures by as much as 50 percent, and providing physicians with an efficient means of making informed choices regarding treatment and care for prostate cancer. The study also showed that the Iso PSA test was much more accurate at recognizing high risk men who needed surgery or other forms of chemotherapy and radiation compared with PSA alone; IsoPSA was over 100 percent more specific in determining whether a prostate cancer patient had advanced cancer and more accurately detected it in patients with a Gleason score above 4 (meaning Gleason is considered high risk); the test has a lower threshold of specificity than existing PSA tests, making it possible to perform more precise screening tests with less time and fewer tests, reducing the number of needless biopsies and lowering the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)Usually have a bad prognosis. A study in Today shows the cancer may be better managed by an new therapy that blocks a fat metabolizer’s action, potentially improving prognosis for this type of cancer and increasing the chances of success for this new therapy for CRPC, a particular type of cancer that can only be cured with drugs that fight the drug-making process of its tumors. “The findings could mean that these drugs, already approved for another type of prostate cancer, will now be used in other diseases to improve prognosis, including those of people with breast, bladder, brain, kidney and melanoma,” explains Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, University of Colorado Cancer Center member. “This may help patients with prostate cancers that have few choices before, and make the drugs more attractive to hospitals and manufacturers for use in treating those cancers.” The researchers focused on CPT1A, a key enzymes involved in metabolic processes in the body and have shown that the enzyme is key to the growth and development of a variety of cells including many cancers. In their study the researchers found that adding a fat oxidation inhibitor makes CRPC more responsive to anti-androgens, a treatment with limited or no effectiveness in treating prostate cancers. The drug was developed in Canada where it was recently granted approval to treat angina but has also been used in Japan and in Europe to treat skin cancer.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Researchers have developed an implantable device that may restore independence to multiple sclerosis and stroke patients by restoring electrical power to parts of their nervous system that were severely injured in the disorders. Two studies show the technology helps two men walk effectively, a step forward in the development of a permanent aid for those suffering paralysis or who are severely affected by either illness. \"We're now in the early stages of making this system more widely available for use in the clinic,\" said Nathan Makowski of the University of Ohio's Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, who helped design the technology. FES is believed to help reduce damage to brain areas associated with walking, gait and balance. Studies have indicated that the system helps patients covered a wider area and covered a wider distance than before, but it is not yet clear what impact this would have on their ability to perform daily tasks, like bathing and dressing or driving. It may be possible to use FES in other chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma and heart failure, but the technology has been used mostly for rehabilitation in stroke patients, according to a new study. More work is required, but the results of this latest research are a significant step forward for the development of a system that will help restore independence and independence for people with MS or strokes, researchers say.\n",

The footage was captured on the beach as the tornado raged across the area, destroying a school, leaving two children in serious condition and forcing hundreds of families to evacuate. The devastated area has been designated an evacuation zone and emergency services are attempting to save the trapped children, but they say there is a real fear that they may be trapped inside their own building or trapped in the storm-hit area if they leave too early. They have been told to avoid all public beaches and dunes until at least Thursday morning because of fears that it will be a \"total meltdown\" when all the rain has ceased and the sun has set for the day. The Australian Lifeguard Service has been asked to respond to a report of several swimmers trapped on the beach as a large storm moves north-west toward the island of St Bart's, where at least four people were killed and more than 100 hurt when a tornado plowed through a small town in central Australia.

But there are also possible pitfalls to take note of, researchers say, including that the study was observational and the data may not always hold up to rigorous replication in randomized controlled trials. The findings could pave the way for clinical trials involving large patient populations and more precise studies of how ketamine affects the brains of individuals living with serious psychiatric conditions, including those struggling with depression and post traumatic stress disorder. \"These findings suggest that ketamine can alleviate depression and could be helpful in treating this serious medical condition without the associated side effects, which are a concern for patients with depression,\" said lead author Ruben A bagyan, PhD. \"Moreover, ketamine appears to be more efficient in killing off harmful brain cells that may be causing depression, which would provide important new evidence for larger clinical trials to determine its use for relief of depressive disorders and other mental health conditions.\"\n",

            "Summary Generated:-A new study suggests that aspirin is linked to reduced breast cancer risk among women who use the medication regularly and at doses low enough that it won't cause a problem for those without previous cancer or other health conditions, reports a new study from the City of Hope, which was published online by the British Journal of Sports Medicine and presented on Tuesday at the International Breast Cancer Conference in San Francisco. The findings suggest that women who use aspirin regularly may be doing more than just reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke, and also may be helping to improve their chances of survival. The findings could have implications for cancer prevention efforts in general, since many women take a combination of prescription and non-prescription medications in addition to taking aspirin for pain and discomfort, experts say. Aspirin is not recommended for people with heart disease, diabetes and some autoimmune conditions, but some doctors advise people who have certain medical conditions -- especially diabetes or asthma -- to start taking aspirin instead of other medication to help prevent pain and improve blood glucose control, so it makes sense that this kind of drug could also have a positive effect on cancer patients' prospects, experts say.\n",

University College London researchers found that it was possible to reveal individual nerve cells dying in the eye before the disease was even discovered. The test, which was first used in clinical trials on patients with  glaucoma, also offers hope for diagnosing other neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Researchers say they have developed a test which can reveal individual nerve cell deaths in the eye before their disease has reached its most fatal stages and prevents sight loss from occurring in the early stages. It is not yet clear if this breakthrough test could soon be available to opticians or if it would be useful for doctors in diagnosing neurodegenerative disease, but research into the technology is being carried out in universities around the UK, as well as other research institutions across the US and the Netherlands. Prof Philip Bloom, Professor of Ophthalmology and lead researcher of the study says: &ldquo; detection of glaucoma early in its development may help prevent sight loss by detecting the earliest signs and helping to treat the disease in a timely manner.

The finding could help treat more Malaria in Africa, where many of the estimated 8.6 million cases occurring annually are caused by malaria parasites that have resistance to standard treatment, but are also increasingly resistant to traditional malaria drugs and are becoming a global public health threat. The paper is published in Phytomedicine and provides the most comprehensive report yet of this drug's possible role in preventing malaria and eradicating it globally. The findings are published alongside a report on the first case in human malaria resistant to the common drug ACT, and offer a new hope for developing effective treatments in Africa, where Malaria has long been considered a global public health hazard and a major contributor to global poverty. The findings may help reduce the rate of Malaria by providing a new option for treating malaria, as well as a potentially lifesaving one that could help to fight the spread of disease in Africa and other places where Malaria still threatens global health, despite progress made to fight it in recent years.\n",

But researchers need to replicate the results to determine if it will cost much less to administer massage therapy to patients than to treat their pain in a more conventional way, which would be expensive and difficult to achieve without additional research and money. The findings, in Annals of the American Medical Assn., also indicate that patients who did not use opioids had significantly less pain from disability after the massage therapy was done, while patients who used drugs to reduce pain reported better pain and longer term improvements in their overall quality of life. The findings are based on the first-ever clinical study of real world massage therapy, but researchers are looking at how massage therapists' techniques can be used in any medical field. \"This study opens the door to the possibility that massage might be considered for a variety of other conditions and disorders that affect the entire body, such as arthritis, diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, but is not covered by insurance or Medicaid, which means it isn't widely used by health care providers and patients who have limited resources.

(March 23, 2016)— Statin Drugs are widely Used to Managing HighCholesterol, reduces the Risk of cardiovascular Disease and Relieves Liver Disease in Those at Elevated Risk of Liver Diseases, Research indicates, statins can improve the health of many livers as used to treat or manage high cholesterol, reducing the risk of some kinds of cancer and other serious illness. Statin drug regimens that are taken to lower cholesterol also have been shown to reduce stress and improve overall health. However, recent research has raised questions regarding the benefits of using these drugs to treat people with chronic liver diseases. A report in the Journal of Physiology finds that a combination of statins can be effective in reducing inflammation and other symptoms of liver diseases in patients at higher risk of cancer and heart attacks, especially in those with advanced liver diseases who are having trouble reducing cholesterol levels. The findings highlight that statins can be used to treat a broad range of liver disorders, but the study authors also acknowledge that statins can cause liver damage, particularly in older patients, and that treatment can cause liver cancer. The authors of the latest report also note that in most patients the use of statins leads to less fibrosis and better scarring and inflammation of tissues, but adds that there are limitations. The team of researchers from the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University notes: “There are limits of effectiveness for these drugs, but we hope this new evidence will inspire doctors and insurers to begin taking statins in the millions more of Americans who are taking them now.” Newswise...\n",

Now there’s good evidence to back up what happened, a new commentary argues, and the drug was approved in 2006 to help people quit smoking for good, not cause health hazards as some feared. t’s not clear how the drug helped those patients but their success is a positive sign for future generations of smokers and smokers in general.

By Dr. Lisa Bair and Dr. Michael P. Cohen, University of California-Berkeley Medical Center: An analysis of medical and economic data from 2009 to 2010 shows that over the last five years varenicline use rose dramatically among smokers with psychiatric disorders and who were taking psychotropic drugs — a trend that could have contributed to the 2009 warning about the drug. But the FDA has been more forthcoming with details, and recent data show that Varenicline may be effective and effective, and is safe. The drug can be prescribed, but there are other ways to achieve it. And many of those other ways are not as safe, as well-intentioned physicians once were, researchers suggest.\n",

A leading expert in Merkel cell carcinoma, the most lethal form of melanoma, is excited about the FDA approval, saying the new drug means more patients who can now benefit from immunotherapy will be diagnosed, given new tools to treat them, and have access to new medications to fight this cancer. “We are seeing an unprecedented amount of enthusiasm for the new therapy among patients, and now we are finally getting some real hope for those suffering with this dangerous and life-threatening disease,” said Prof. John F. Huocheng, MD, associate dean for research at Fred Hutch and head of the University of Washington’s Center of Clinical Science. A practicing doctor treating patients with metastatic melanoma, he sees more patients who now have a new option in immunotherapy and know that their treatment plans are now in line with the clinical trial results, and that there is now an opportunity to better tailor the drug to those patients with specific mutations of immune cells in the tumors, making them particularly attractive for patients with advanced tumors with limited options and who are not well-matched with traditional therapies, said Nghiem.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-The results of a major study that looked at side effects of surgery for prostate cancer are not surprising because there has been evidence for years that it is best to avoid the treatments, and this study offers the latest insight into what may be more important in deciding who should take the most drastic action in treating prostate cancer. The results were released online in the journal JAMA Oncology Tuesday, April 28, 2014. The study included more than 2,900 men with prostate cancer who had one of three kinds of treatment for prostate cancer including surgery or radiation and had a normal risk of contracting the disease, or having some of it, and were followed for three years following surgery or radiation to determine their risk for complications such as erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence and bowel function ( bowel function), which is often an indication of how the cancer will do in the months and even years ahead. The study showed that men who received surgery had more sexual and urinary problems than those who received radiation, but the two types of treatments also had significantly better outcomes than those given surgery, which was thought to result in a better prognosis, said the authors of the study. The findings show that, even in a small population, radiation is not the best treatment for a small fraction of prostate-cell tumors. In fact, radiotherapy is not the only treatment used for small populations and, in some cases, surgery and radiation are used more often in small patients, but they have far larger effects than radiotherapy does.\n",

The study also showed SBRT may be viable for some older patients who are willing to go through the pain and discomfort of surgery in order to receive this treatment, but are uncertain whether it is worth the cost or risk of the treatment, since the risks of side effects and the time needed for treatment may increase the cost to the patient if the cancer is still in the body two years later, when the cancer is more aggressive and the cancer could spread to another area of the body or organ. “While many doctors have expressed concern that elderly patients are not suited for SBRT as they have no previous experience with the radiation therapy and may be less willing to tolerate the high doses, the data show that the treatment can be safely used in elderly patients, who may be better suited to receiving it after a procedure to remove the tumor is done, even if they cannot undergo it,” said Richard Cassidy III, MD, Emory University Research Associate and Lead Author of a new research paper. “These patients are at a higher risk for having other cancers recur and we hope our findings encourage more doctors to look into this option for this population.”\n",

The research supports the use of a low dose CT exam to find lung cancers in patients who don't need surgery and may not show any symptoms, but may have underlying medical conditions that make finding it more difficult. \"Lung cancer has shown to be very effective in detecting it early and finding it in its early stages so it's a very important cancer that can be cured with surgery and other treatments if we can prevent its progression,\" Dr. Carsten Schroeder said, author of the new study in Southern Medical Journal. He said that although lung cancer has long been associated with a poor survival rate and that the death toll could rise without better prevention and detection, the latest data on screening shows it can find it at an earlier point in its growth. \"As we look to improve outcomes, we must continue to reduce costs, increase quality of life in communities, and expand our testing to include those who are not at high-risk but who may not have the potential to benefit from our current screening methods,\" Schroeder said, co-author of the study, published in the April 7, 2017 online publication in Southern Medical Journal\n",

Huerter, MD News wise — Hospitals can improve patient care and reduce costsassociated with coronary angioplasty if cardiologyists perform more of these procedures via an artery in the Wrist, as opposed to the traditional femoral artery which has a smaller opening that is more dangerous to navigate and can result in longer hospital stays for patients who undergo angioplasty procedures, according to the new research. The findings are reported in a recent study of almost 280,000 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty, or PCI, which involves removing narrowed arteries from the coronary arteries with Balloons or stents to widen narrowed arteries that lead to shortness of breath. The study suggests that by using less risky methods, hospitals will save millions of dollars a year for patients and the government, as they would have fewer complications, shorter stays in the hospital and fewer patients discharged the same day as their operations. In addition to saving money, this new technique also has other benefits including fewer complications that can be managed by a skilled medical staff, and quicker recovery after surgery, the researchers say. Patients who receive angioplasty procedures via the wrist or groin are able to depart the hospital earlier and remain at home the next morning. The same day is when the biggest risks happen. “If we could make these procedures more common, there could be more patients treated and more patients discharged sooner.

MRI can detect aggressive tumors that were missed during ultrasound or mammography, but are often overlooked in the densest breast tissues because of density. MRI detected more aggressive cancers than any other test, and it also showed better sensitivity than ultrasound--which may be due to improved contrast quality, which is critical in identifying tumors as they're growing. According to the report, MRI also detected more cancers that are still growing before they're caught, a discovery particularly useful in women with dense breast tissues, who are at increased risk of interval cancers. The finding suggests MRI is superior to ultrasound--one of the more popular forms of imaging in cancer detection--especially for detecting cancers that are not detected by conventional screening tools such as mammography, ultrasound or mammogram. Dr. Kuhl and colleagues found that 59 invasive cancers were detected using MRI in this population. \"These results are important for the future of early detection and provide new guidance for patients and providers about how MRI can benefit patients in many different settings, including those with high-risk status,\" she said.\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Study shows that radiotherapy can reduce complications without compromising surgery, and that it is possible to delay surgery after radiotherapy, without compromising on its efficacy, writes Elizabeth Thorpe. The findings show that treatment with shorter wavelengths has the greatest impact on patients' lives, while treatments using long- wavelengths appear to have the most negative impact on them. The findings of the Swedish study, which has just been published in The Lancet Oncology, have major implications for both patients and hospitals, as they may lead to more effective radiotherapy and better outcomes for the people with rectal cancer who are already receiving it, and for doctors themselves, as it may provide an efficient way to control the side effects of radiotherapy, and allow more time for patients to be properly fitted for their surgeries, allowing them to go about their daily tasks without having to be in hospital for several months before a new treatment can be tried or tested, or delayed. The findings have huge implications for both patients and doctors, with implications for improved treatment methods and improved outcome rates for patients, and for the future development of better treatments and treatments that can be delivered in a shorter period of time\n",

The results were found in an experiment of laryngeal cancer patients at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. The results have been replicated worldwide and the study was published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, and it will be widely discussed at the ASCO meetings this weekend in Washington, DC. \"We know that the first round of chemotherapy can be very aggressive for some patients with cancer, and there are other kinds of cancer treatment that are more common, but for the most part we still don't see an increased chance of success with this particular type of chemotherapy,\" says senior author Francis Worden. \"We wanted to find a treatment that would help the most patients. This approach provides a much more stable, predictable way of treating cancer that is effective at fighting the disease and avoiding the complications that often occur after a single cycle of chemotherapy, without the side effects. It's an excellent, safe treatment option, and we are seeing results that could improve the lives of many patients in the future.\"\n",

            "Summary Generated:-Researchers at Rockefeller University report that a powerful antibody may offer a new and effective approach to treating HIV--for people at risk for acquiring the virus, even in cases when antiretroviral drugs do no better. The discovery appears in the latest issue of Proceedings of the American Academy of Allergy, Sports, and Biological Sciences (PACS), out this Wednesday, June 9, in an online journal, The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study was the first clinical study to test a new type of antibody, which is one of many being tested in research on AIDS--that can neutralize and even kill HIV virus in humans. It is not currently available for patients infected with the disease. The finding could provide a new weapon for doctors looking for new approaches for treating HIV, as well as a means of preventing its spread among people at higher risk for acquiring HIV, who often are unable to receive antiretroviral therapy because of side effects or poor immune system function. The findings are part of a larger scientific effort to develop new approaches to treat HIV in people whose immune systems may not cooperate well with traditional antiretroviral therapies. In the longer term, the investigators hope that the antibody might be developed into a new kind of drug that could be given to those who are at risk for acquiring HIV in the long run, but only if they take a high enough dose of the medicine to prevent viral infection.\n",

Trulance works to support regular bowel function while improving symptoms in adults, helping to increase stool consistency and consistency, and decrease the number of times a day when someone needs to urinate. According to the NIH, chronic idiopathic constipation has affected 42 million Americans, or about one out of two people in the population. Trulance is available in a daily orally administered form that is designed to be convenient for those without insurance or an existing healthcare plan and may provide a cost savings for their physicians. Trulance also does not treat the underlying causes of constipation—for instance, the fact that the stools are often bloated or watery, which may result in vomiting or diarrhea. Patients who experience these conditions may find it difficult to get adequate rest, as well as suffer other health consequences such as weight gain or increased blood pressure, including high cholesterol, heart disease and some types of cancer. Trulance also can cause some cancers to develop in the body, such as breast, ovary, sarcoma, and brain cancer, causing significant damage to cells, and some cancers may spread beyond the body. Trulance may also be associated with liver and colorectal cancer, but this drug is approved for only these cancers. For Immediate Release: Jan. 20, 2017\n",

The results were published January 13, 2017, online, in the journal \" Neurotrauma,\" as an \"expat,\" or proof-of-concept study that may provide clues to better care of patients following concussions, researchers said. The study involved 45 people with mild brain trauma -- a type of concussion that involves a hard landing on the head but does not require serious bleeding or bruising, or any other signs of brain injury. They were asked to ignore the symptoms for three weeks after the injury, and then they had MRIs to detect abnormal brain activity. The analysis showed patterns of brain activity six months after the scans that indicated a higher risk for post-concussive symptoms like headache, dizziness or confusion, even among people with no signs of brain injury, researchers said. In the long run, these data may help doctors and patients better understand their unique needs and expectations after concussion, the researchers said, which could lead to more targeted, earlier treatment of concussion patients, and potentially less long-term harm to their brains.\n",

Regorafenib was the only drug shown to improve survival in people who had advanced stage of advanced HCC, a cancer that usually progresses within three months after initial treatment, even after the most commonly prescribed drugs have already failed to do much for them. The FDA granted priority review status to the drug earlier this month, saying it provides evidence of benefit in treating advanced stage of liver cancer for which no approved drug is available, especially since the disease typically strikes patients who are already at high risk because of factors such as smoking or being African American or Latino. The trial was conducted over 21 sites worldwide and involved 152 patients with advanced, Stage III or III chronic liver tumors. Dr. Llovet and Charissa Chang are both co- authors of the latest study in Lancet, published on January 16, 2017, which was based on a large international, multinational, clinical trial of the new drug.\n",

The study's first authors added that this finding should have broad implications for patients, who often face a much different diagnosis than European- Americans, who also face increased likelihood of tumor recurrence during breast cancer treatment. \"Further research to determine the exact role chemotherapy may have in preventing or lessening recurrence is needed to determine whether it actually helps patients survive longer after surgery, or even if it causes tumors to return when they're no longer localized to the body,\" said Dr. Robert A. Hall, a professor of medical science and radiation therapy at the Atlanta Cancer Institute. \"Our findings show that chemo regimens prior to surgery may improve survival in African-Americans, but it is important to understand the differences between blacks and Europeans to develop more effective regimens for treatment of cancer in black patients,\" he said. \"We are encouraged that this treatment is improving cancer survival in African American women, though there are many more patients to treat with this tool, including those with Stage IV tumors that have returned, which may be why our study shows it is beneficial in these patients.\"\n",

A study conducted in the Netherlands showed lap band surgery to be more effective in teens who were morbidly overweight, but not necessarily obese, than those with a BMI under 40 kg. The procedure was also more effective when used on children who were already obese but not yet overweight, the study found. “It is still the most effective option available to overweight and obese teenagers if they wish to make the choice on a long term basis for managing their condition,” Dr Pea says. “The surgery is reversible, allowing teenagers to mature into a more informed decision whether they wish to undergo a longer-term operation or simply have the procedure as a short-term solution to morbid obesity. Lap band surgery has been shown to work effectively in adults with severe obesity and this work shows it can be done safely in children and adolescents who are severely obese.

The findings may be important for patients with heart disease, those who have been treated with more aggressive treatments and for those whose blood pressure is in a \"gray zone\" where they do not need treatment, but who may be at risk for heart disease or who may already be taking anti-clotting medication, such as aspirin or stents. p>According to researchers from Johns Hopkins and colleagues, a scan that reveals the presence of calcium in coronary arteries may help physicians determine how aggressively to treat certain high-risk patients and help predict their future risks for heart disease, diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. These tests can also predict how many heart attacks or strokes would be avoided if someone with high blood pressure was treated appropriately. This new finding may be especially important for people who have high blood pressure, or who are taking medication for heart disease, because the risk for heart attack or heart disease increases as the number of people with blood pressure is high, and therefore more often those people will have a heart attack or a stroke, or are at particular risk of them. If doctors know which individuals should be aggressively treated, they can determine what therapy is most beneficial. This new data could improve treatment and management strategies, according to the National Health Service's 2015-2020-2020 Strategic Health Plan, a program that tracks the effects of various health systems' policies and initiatives across sectors.\n",

The results, published in Fertility & Sterility, could be important in cases where multiple miscarriages have occurred or are occurring too often, and could have other consequences, including increased risk of other serious medical conditions. The study involved women in their early to late reproductive years, when a first pregnancy is less than a month old. About 25 percent of American women give birth within the first two to four weeks of pregnancy. A third of such women will suffer a loss of a pregnancy within four weeks, and about 40 percent of them will have another loss within a decade of conception, but most of those cases are resolved within the first 12 weeks. For these women, one solution may be a combination of treatment and lifestyle changes that may prevent a loss of a pregnancy.

It may provide hope for many of the more than 80,000 women worldwide who face a triple negative diagnosis of HER2 breast cancer - the most deadly form of cancer - and may provide a new option for patients with early stage disease, or who have already tried other treatments and seen little benefit. The drug is also in a late stage FDA review for other breast cancer conditions, but the results from this latest trial could have a big impact on that development, which will determine whether tucatinib gets the fast-track status that is awarded to drugs that have shown great promise, especially when used against cancer in other forms of tumors, including prostate, lung, ovarian and skin cancers. A phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Israel found tucatinib was more effective than a standard of treatment in treating some patients with breast cancer whose tumors had responded to other treatments. Tucatinib may also have an important sideeffect: it is thought to cause some patients' immune cells to attack cancer cells, making it vulnerable to infection. \"When we saw these data in Israel we thought that this could help a huge group of patients, especially in the early stages, and we've seen this in other diseases, too, so we're very excited now,\" Borges says.\n",
